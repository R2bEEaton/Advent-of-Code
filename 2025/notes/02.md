Cool puzzle, definitely feel like this is a Regex lesson? Slower as compared to others the NJIT ACM leaderboard. My nemeses [Ari Kamat](https://github.com/arikamat) and [TJ O](https://github.com/TJThePiGuy) have returned! I am now tied with Ari at first.

## Part One
Pretty simple, check if the first half of any IDs in the range are equal to their second half.

[Code](../code/02a.py)

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

ans = 0

for id in din.split(","):
    id1, id2 = id.split("-")
    for x in range(int(id1), int(id2) + 1):
        xs = str(x)
        if xs[:len(xs)//2] == xs[len(xs)//2:]:
            ans += x

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part Two
Knew I needed Regex right away, but how long has it been since I wrote a Regex myself from scratch!

Two crucial things:

1. Lazy operator `?` was necessary to get the matcher to match as few characters as necessary to get the whole thing to match.

2. The end of line operator `$` was necessary because by default `re.match` is not global. I used this to force the whole ID to match all the way to the end.

[Code](../code/02b.py)

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import re

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

ans = 0

for id in din.split(","):
    id1, id2 = id.split("-")
    for x in range(int(id1), int(id2) + 1):
        xs = str(x)
        if re.match(r"(.+?)\1+$", xs):
            ans += x

aocd_submit(ans)
```
