# Day 6 - Trash Compactor

> [<- Yesterday](05.md) | [Tomorrow ->](07.md)

Fun puzzle! Though I can't help but feel that being half way through the 12 days of Advent of Code, it was quite easy... What's coming?

## Part One
Kind of a funny quick solution, just read the columns, intersperse the numbers with the operator, and `eval`!

The weird double-getting of the data is because I wanted to use my `numbers=True` flag but also still get the last row, which are not numbers. Maybe I should make a feature for this helper so that rows that aren't numbers just get returned as a string, or maybe even split on spaces.

[Code](../code/06a.py)

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)
# Just the quickest way in the moment I could think of to get the last line
ops = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)[0][-1].split()

ans = 0

for y in range(len(din[0])):
    s = ""
    for x in range(len(din) - 1):
        s += str(din[x][y])
        s += ops[y]
    ans += eval(str(s[:-1]))

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part Two
Quite happy with this one, as well as the speed with which I did it!

I simply iterated reading columns one character at a time from right to left. For each column, I built a string and then used `int(new_num)` to convert the string to a number, which handles all the whitespaces nicely. Since I'm now at the end of the column, I append this number to a list, and then reset the string. Repeat until one of the operator characters is found. Because of how nicely it's laid out, this always happens last. Then, convert the current string, and either add it to or multiply it by the sum or product of the current array, then add that to the total to progress toward the answer! The columns between problems are all spaces, so I just check if `int(' ')` fails, which it always does for a string of only whitespaces, and reset the current numbers list for the next problem!

It's probably slowed down for using strings, but that's ok. [Mere milliseconds mean NOTHING to me!](05.md#part-three---raynas-solution)

[Code](../code/06b.py)

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from math import prod

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

ans = 0

curr_nums = []
for x in range(len(din[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
    new_num = ""
    for y in range(len(din)):
        if din[y][x] == "*":
            ans += prod(curr_nums) * int(new_num)
        if din[y][x] == "+":
            ans += sum(curr_nums) + int(new_num)
        new_num += din[y][x]
    
    try:
        curr_nums.append(int(new_num))
    except:
        curr_nums.clear()

aocd_submit(ans)
```
