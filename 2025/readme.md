# Ryan Eaton's Advent of Code 2025

A repository to store my solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

**This year is being completed syncronously again, ideally. Yipee!**

Solutions will be slightly refactored for readability before submission. In other words...

```diff
+ Refactor to remove unused code
- No logic changes allowed
- No fixing the stupid or unnecessary checks I wrote
+ Code must produce valid solutions
```

I'm going for speed, maybe? [This year's changes make that less serious.](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about#faq_leaderboard) We'll see how this evolves. This repository is not an example of good code, *or maybe it will be if I have the rest of the month to revisit the puzzles?* A lot is up in the air this year.

## Epithets and Eternities

This is pretty much a table of contents for my solution times and equivalent points.
