## Problem Summary

Given a racetrack with a direct path from start to finish, the driver is allowed to cheat once for 2 time steps in a row. During a cheat, the car is allowed to move through walls but the cheat must end on a track position. Moving one position down the track each time step, how many cheats are there that would save 100 time steps or more. Then in Part 2, how many cheats are there that would save 100 time steps or more given the driver is allowed to cheat once for up to 20 time steps. It is important to note that unique cheats are identified by their start and ending position.

## Part 1

I started with a BFS / AStar solution but I realized that wasn't getting anywhere so I pivoted after way too long to the new idea I had... just check each position and check 2 positions away and get the difference in time between when the driver would be there normally. To achieve this, I just set every race track position to the time step that the car would reach there normally. And you have to subtract 2 from the difference because you still need to travel on the cheat path. If the difference was positive and greater than or equal to 100, it's a cheat that saves 100!

```python
import heapq
from helpers.matrix import DIRS_URDL, from_grid
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

M = from_grid(din)
best = len(M.findall(".")) + 1

seen = set()
pos = M.findall("S")[0]
cost = 0

while M.get(pos) != "E":
    M.set(pos, cost)
    seen.add(pos)
    for nei, val in M.neighbors(pos):
        if val is None:
            continue
        if nei not in seen and val in ".E":
            pos = nei
            break
    cost += 1
M.set(pos, cost)

saves_100 = 0

for pos, val in M:
    if val == "#":
        continue
    for d in DIRS_URDL:
        new_pos = tuple(pos[i] + d[i] + d[i] for i in range(2))
        if M.get(new_pos) not in [None, "#"]:
            saves = M.get(new_pos) - M.get(pos) - 2
            if saves >= 100:
                saves_100 += 1

aocd_submit(saves_100)
```

## Part 2

This solution takes 9 minutes to run on my machine I think, and it's really dumb! For each track position in the racetrack, I iterated over ALL of the other track positions (including walls, including positions way farther than 20 away) and then checked whether that new position was within 20. Super silly! I saw TJ's solution after and he just precomputed the 41 wide diamond shape... But hey it worked and I got to go to bed at a reasonable time!

```python
import heapq
from helpers.matrix import DIRS_URDL, from_grid
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import math
import tqdm

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

M = from_grid(din)
best = len(M.findall(".")) + 1

seen = set()
pos = M.findall("S")[0]
cost = 0

while M.get(pos) != "E":
    M.set(pos, cost)
    seen.add(pos)
    for nei, val in M.neighbors(pos):
        if val is None:
            continue
        if nei not in seen and val in ".E":
            pos = nei
            break
    cost += 1
M.set(pos, cost)

saves_100 = 0

for pos, val in tqdm.tqdm(M):
    if val == "#":
        continue
    for new_pos, new_val in M:
        dist = abs(pos[0] - new_pos[0]) + abs(pos[1] - new_pos[1])
        if dist <= 20:
            if new_val not in [None, "#"]:
                saves = new_val - val - dist
                if saves >= 100:
                    saves_100 += 1

aocd_submit(saves_100)
```
