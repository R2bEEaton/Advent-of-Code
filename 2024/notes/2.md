# Day 2 - Red-Nosed Reports

> [<- Yesterday](1.md) | [Tomorrow ->](3.md)

Advent of 500 Server errors? I couldn't get into the puzzle for over a minute, and had to begin reading it on my phone. And then when I had an answer, it would not let me submit for a while.

|        | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Time   | 7:47   | 1:40   | 9:27  |
| Points | 0      | 0      | 0     |

## Part 1

My slowdown on this part was a typo, checking if `3 <= x <= 1` which is impossible, I had meant to swap the numbers. And the 500 errors.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)
ans = 0

for line in din:
    all_increasing = True
    all_decreasing = True

    for i in range(len(line)  -1):
        if not (-3 <= (line[i+1] - line[i]) <= -1):
            all_decreasing = False
            break

    for i in range(len(line)  -1):
        if not (1 <= (line[i+1] - line[i]) <= 3):
            all_increasing = False
            break

    if all_decreasing or all_increasing:
        ans += 1

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

Super straightforward, again, except for 500 errors. Seems I'm still on the global leaderboard, even though I didn't get any points. Fortunately this day will probably be invalidated due to widespread server errors reported by more than just me.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)
ans = 0


def is_safe(line):
    all_increasing = True
    all_decreasing = True

    for i in range(len(line)  -1):
        if not (-3 <= (line[i+1] - line[i]) <= -1):
            all_decreasing = False
            break

    for i in range(len(line)  -1):
        if not (1 <= (line[i+1] - line[i]) <= 3):
            all_increasing = False
            break

    return all_decreasing or all_increasing


for line in din:
    if is_safe(line):
        ans += 1
        continue

    for i in range(len(line)):
        line_copy = line.copy()
        del line_copy[i]
        if is_safe(line_copy):
            ans += 1
            break

aocd_submit(ans)
```
