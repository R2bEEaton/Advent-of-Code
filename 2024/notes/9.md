# Day 9 - Disk Fragmenter

> [<- Yesterday](8.md) | [Tomorrow ->](10.md)

A quicker-ish one, and a pretty good global rank too. Glad to get to go to bed early after some late nights. But of course I won't, I'll stick around and talk in the NJIT chat :).

## Part 1

First I built a list of IDs and empty space, equivalent to the representation in the example. From there, it was a simple pointers-based approach. I say pointers as if I was using a doubly-linked list or something, but in reality it slowed down since I used Python lists instead of something like `deque`. As I've learned in the past, `list` has slow deletions, but it gets the job done in a few seconds here.

Keep a left and right pointer, and increment the left pointer until you find a `.`, and decrement the right pointer until you find a non-`.`, then swap them and repeat until the pointers cross! I needed to do one additional swap at the end because the internal while loops end up crossing each other after the final swap.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

ans = 0

file = True
data = []
id = 0

for num in din:
    num = int(num)
    for _ in range(num):
        data.append(id if file else '.')
    if file:
        id += 1
    file = not file

l = 0
r = len(data) -1


def swap(data, l, r):
    temp = data[l]
    data[l] = data[r]
    data[r] = temp


while l <= r:
    while data[l] != ".":
        l += 1
    while data[r] == ".":
        r -= 1
    swap(data, l, r)

swap(data, l, r)

for i, num in enumerate(data):
    if num == ".":
        break
    ans += i * int(num)

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

This one needed a pretty substantial re-write. I knew I could do some silly checks for the size of each empty block in the Part 1 code, but I figured that would be slow due to the aforementioned slow list deletions and insertions. So instead, I still used lists! But rather than keeping track of each individual location in memory, I created a list of contiguous file IDs and free space, along with their lengths. Then, starting from the right, check if there's a free space to the left big enough to hold it. Replace the file with the equivalent empty space, and the empty space with the file, making sure to insert a new free space record after it if there was any left over.

Now that I think of it, my 2 `del` operations are kind of unnecessary, as I could just do a swap like before, except keep the original length of the file when making it empty. The only change would then be inserting the new free space if it was needed... that would have looked a lot cleaner. And you wouldn't even need to mess with the right pointer since there are alternating files and free space anyway.

This would look something like this:

```python
remaining = data[l][1] - data[r][1]
data[l] = data[r]
data[r] = ("free", data[r][1])
if remaining > 0:
    data.insert(l+1, ("free", remaining))
```

Hmm, but this takes the same amount of time. And replacing the list with a `deque` takes double the time. I give up. Here's what I used for my submission:

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

ans = 0

file = True
data = []
id = 0

for num in din:
    num = int(num)
    if file:
        data.append((id, num))
        id += 1
    else:
        data.append(("free", num))
    file = not file

seen = set()

r = len(data) - 1
while r >= 0:
    while data[r][0] == "free" or data[r][0] in seen:
        r -= 1
        if r == 0:
            idx = 0
            for thing in data:
                if thing[0] != "free":
                    for _ in range(thing[1]):
                        ans += thing[0] * idx
                        idx += 1
                else:
                    idx += thing[1]
            aocd_submit(ans)
            exit()
    seen.add(data[r][0])
    for l in range(r):
        if data[l][0] == "free" and data[l][1] >= data[r][1]:
            # print(f"found a spot for {data[r][0]} at {l}")
            remaining = data[l][1] - data[r][1]
            del data[l]
            data.insert(l, data[r - 1])
            data.insert(r + 1, ("free", data[r][1]))
            del data[r]
            if remaining > 0:
                data.insert(l+1, ("free", remaining))
            # print(data)
            break
```
