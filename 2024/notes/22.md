## Problem Summary

Given a secret number, there is a way to evolve the secret number into the next secret number with a predetermined process. Repeat that 2000 times and then add the 2000th evolved secret number for each starting secret number in the input.

For Part 2, take the last digit of each of the 2000 secret numbers in a chain from each starting number, and determine the difference between each of them. What is the highest sum of all those last digits that come after the first occurrence of a specific set of 4 differences in a row. I don't know if that makes any sense. [Read the problem I guess?](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/22)

## Part 1

I made mix and prune into functions because I thought I'd need to change them later, but didn't end up needing to. It was just a matter of computing the 2000th next secret number for each starting secret number and then summing them all. Super simple, unfortunately 3rd in NJIT even though I felt like I did it pretty fast. I got tripped up on mixing, I wasn't sure if the original secret number was mixed in or the new current one.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)


def mix(v, n):
    return v ^ n


def prune(n):
    return n % 16777216


ans = 0
for line in din:
    secret = line[0]
    for _ in range(2000):
        secret = mix(secret * 64, secret)
        secret = prune(secret)
        secret = mix(secret // 32, secret)
        secret = prune(secret)
        secret = mix(secret * 2048, secret)
        secret = prune(secret)
    ans += secret

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

I got this one pretty fast, I think right from the start... after reading it a couple of times. All I needed to do was compute the set of differences for each and then slide over every 4 differences (including overlap) and add the corresponding price to a `defaultdict` with the differences being the key. Then, just pick the max value among all the keys!

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)


def mix(v, n):
    return v ^ n


def prune(n):
    return n % 16777216


windows = defaultdict(int)

for line in din:
    secret = line[0]
    prices = [secret % 10]
    for _ in range(2000):
        secret = mix(secret * 64, secret)
        secret = prune(secret)
        secret = mix(secret // 32, secret)
        secret = prune(secret)
        secret = mix(secret * 2048, secret)
        secret = prune(secret)
        prices.append(secret % 10)
    diffs = [prices[i] - prices[i-1] for i in range(1, len(prices))]
    seen = set()
    for i in range(len(diffs) - 4):
        if tuple(diffs[i:i+4]) in seen:
            continue
        seen.add(tuple(diffs[i:i+4]))
        windows[tuple(diffs[i:i+4])] += prices[i+4]

aocd_submit(max(windows.values()))
```
