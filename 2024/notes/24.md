# Day 24 - Crossed Wires

Really really cool problem! Ended up 2nd and 2nd in NJIT for this problem. TJ's really good! I'll get him next year...

## Problem Summary

Given a series of wires and logic gates, we were supposed to simulate the system and then convert all the wires starting with z00-z44 to a single binary number as the answer to Part 1.

For Part 2, it was revealed that the system was supposed to simulate a 45-bit adder. Except, four pairs of gate outputs had been swapped. The answer was to determine the bad wires (a total of 8), sort them alphabetically and separate by commas.

## Part 1

This was just a simple simulation problem which unfortunately took a while because I was trying to do it with `lambda`s instead of the obviously easy way.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

wires = {}
gates = []

initial = True
for line in din:
    if line == "":
        initial = False
        continue
    
    if initial:
        wire, val = line.split(": ")
        wires[wire] = int(val)
    else:
        wire_a, gate, wire_b, _, wire = line.split(" ")
        gates.append((wire_a, gate, wire_b, wire))


def do_gate(a, g, b):
    if g == "AND":
        return a & b
    elif g == "XOR":
        return a ^ b
    elif g == "OR":
        return a | b


while gates:
    for gate_x in gates:
        wire_a, gate, wire_b, wire = gate_x
        if wire_a in wires and wire_b in wires:
            wires[wire] = do_gate(wires[wire_a], gate, wires[wire_b])
            gates.remove(gate_x)
            break

# print(wires)

zs = []
for wire in wires:
    if wire.startswith("z"):
        zs.append(wire)

zs.sort()
zs.reverse()

# print(zs)
ans = 0
for wire in zs:
    print(wires[wire])
    ans |= wires[wire]
    ans <<= 1
ans >>= 1

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

The code below displays a graph of the network, but it's not important for the solution really.

Basically my solution went as follows:

- Coding random unhelpful things
- Looked up the circuit for a full adder
- Determined that there were the correct number of AND, XOR, and OR gates for a 45 bit ripple adder
- Manually going through with `Ctrl+F` + Regular Expressions to find gates that weren't possible
  - For example if z?? is the output, then the gate must be an XOR
  - All x and y bits must be both XORed and ANDed
  - The result of x?? AND y?? must be used in an OR
  - The result of x?? XOR y?? must be used in an XOR
  - and so on

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import networkx as nx
from pyvis.network import Network

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

wires = {}
gates = []

G = nx.DiGraph()

initial = True
for line in din:
    if line == "":
        initial = False
        continue
    
    if initial:
        wire, val = line.split(": ")
        wires[wire] = int(val)
    else:
        wire_a, gate, wire_b, _, wire = line.split(" ")
        gates.append((wire_a, gate, wire_b, wire))
        G.add_edge(wire_a, f"{wire_a}_{wire_b}_{gate}")
        G.add_edge(wire_b, f"{wire_a}_{wire_b}_{gate}")
        G.add_edge(f"{wire_a}_{wire_b}_{gate}", wire)

net = Network(
    directed = True,
    select_menu = True, # Show part 1 in the plot (optional)
    filter_menu = True, # Show part 2 in the plot (optional)
)
net.show_buttons() # Show part 3 in the plot (optional)
net.from_nx(G) # Create directly from nx graph
net.show('day24vis.html', notebook=False)
