# Day 12 - Garden Groups

> [<- Yesterday](11.md) | [Tomorrow ->](13.md)

A very slow one for me! With the anonymous person finally kicked, that put me at 2nd and 7th in NJIT, and I am now tied with my nemesis, [TJThePiGuy](https://github.com/TJThePiGuy/AdventOfCode). This is the first day when I just had to go to bed and work on it on the morning.

|      | Part 1 | Part 2  | Total       |

| Time | 16:40  | 9:34:36 | Σ = 9:51:16 |

## Problem Summary

Given a 2 dimensional grid of garden space, find connected regions of the same type of flower. Then, for each group, multiply the number of spaces in the group by the perimeter of the group. That's Part 1. Then for Part 2, instead of the perimeter, multiply by the number of sides the group has.

## Part 1

This one was fine, just count the size of the regions.

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from helpers.matrix import DIRS_URDL, from_grid
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

M = from_grid(din, data_type=str)

seen = set()
regions = defaultdict(int)
perimeters = defaultdict(int)

for pos, val in M:
    if pos in seen:
        continue
    seen.add(pos)

    next = [pos]
    seen_this_time = set()
    seen_this_time.add(pos)
    while next:
        curr = next.pop()
        for dir in DIRS_URDL:
            npos = tuple(curr[i] + dir[i] for i in range(2))
            if npos in seen_this_time:
                continue
            if M.get(npos) == val:
                seen.add(npos)
                seen_this_time.add(npos)
                next.append(npos)
            else:
                perimeters[pos] += 1
    regions[pos] = len(seen_this_time)

ans = 0
for i, j in zip(regions.values(), perimeters.values()):
    ans += i * j

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

But then this one... I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to count corners, sides, [internal angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_and_external_angles), or whatever it would have taken to get me the number of sides. I worked on it for a solid 3 hours before going to bed defeated, and all the main people that do it on release in NJIT had finished already :(.

Then when I got in bed, I was thinking about it for another 30 minutes and came up with the idea that ended up working in the morning.

- For each row of the region, count continuous sections of top edges.
- For each row of the region, count continuous sections of bottom edges.
- For each column of the region, count continuous sections of left edges.
- For each column of the region, count continuous sections of right edges.

Add them all up, and that's the number of sides. Visually, this is like scanning from each direction and counting the number of sides that intersect your scan line. In [TJ's solution](https://github.com/TJThePiGuy/AdventOfCode/blob/main/2024/notes/12.md), he noticed the fact that the number of horizontal sides is always equal to the number of vertical sides, so my code does a little unnecessary work but I am not touching this ever again!

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from helpers.matrix import DIRS_URDL, DIRS_DIAG, from_grid
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

M = from_grid(din, data_type=str)

seen = set()
regions_cells = defaultdict(set)

for pos, val in M:
    if pos in seen:
        continue
    seen.add(pos)

    next = [pos]
    region = regions_cells[pos]
    while next:
        curr = next.pop()
        region.add(curr)
        for dir in DIRS_URDL:
            npos = tuple(curr[i] + dir[i] for i in range(2))
            if npos in seen:
                continue
            if M.get(npos) == val:
                seen.add(npos)
                next.append(npos)


def count_continuous(l):
    inside = False
    sides = 0
    for n in l:
        if n == 1 and inside == False:
            inside = True
            sides += 1
        elif n == 0:
            inside = False
    return sides


ans = 0

for pos, vals in regions_cells.items():
    ys = [y for y, x in vals]
    xs = [x for y, x in vals]
    origin = (min(ys), min(xs))
    val = M.get(pos)
    br = (max(ys) + 1, max(xs) + 1)
    sides = 0

    # Count up and down sides for each row
    for y in range(origin[0], br[0]):
        top_edge = []
        bottom_edge = []
        for x in range(origin[1], br[1]):
            if (y, x) not in vals:
                top_edge.append(0)
                bottom_edge.append(0)
                continue
            top_edge.append(1 if (y-1, x) not in vals else 0)
            bottom_edge.append(1 if (y+1, x) not in vals else 0)
        sides += count_continuous(top_edge)
        sides += count_continuous(bottom_edge)

    # Count left and right sides for each column
    for x in range(origin[1], br[1]):
        left_edge = []
        right_edge = []
        for y in range(origin[0], br[0]):
            if (y, x) not in vals:
                left_edge.append(0)
                right_edge.append(0)
                continue
            left_edge.append(1 if (y, x-1) not in vals else 0)
            right_edge.append(1 if (y, x+1) not in vals else 0)
        sides += count_continuous(left_edge)
        sides += count_continuous(right_edge)

    ans += len(vals) * sides

aocd_submit(ans)
```
