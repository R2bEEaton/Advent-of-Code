# Day 10 - Hoof It

> [<- Yesterday](9.md) | [Tomorrow ->](11.md)

Duuude I had the solution for Part 2 by 5:45, even before Part 1 due to not reading :). I wouldn't have gotten on the leaderboard, but would have placed significantly better which would have been cool. In NJIT, I got 2nd for Part 1 and 1st for Part 2, not counting the suspicious anonymous person nobody knows.

## Problem Summary

This problem is about a map that includes height information from 0 to 9. That's the input. From each "trailhead" (0), you can only step **up** 1 unit per step. So you can move from 0 to a 1 next to you, then to a 2 next to that, and so on up to potentially a "peak" (9). Part 1 asks how many peaks you can reach from all trailheads, and Part 2 asks how many unique paths there are to those peaks.

## Part 1

I had some issues with my recent changes to my matrix helper, but after that it was smooth-ish sailing!

Not realizing that it was asking for how many destinations, I coded BFS to count the number of *unique paths* to the destination. And like I said, according to my video I had that at around 5:45, which would have been a pretty good time! For an additional almost 6 minutes I *didn't* read the problem back again and just assumed I did something wrong. I finally read over the problem again and saw my mistake, so I added a check to make sure I never cross the same place twice, and that solved it!

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from helpers.matrix import *

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

M = from_grid(din, data_type=int)
trailheads = M.findall(0)
ans = 0

for head in trailheads:
    bfs = [head]
    seen = set()
    while bfs:
        new_bfs = []
        for thing in bfs:
            if thing in seen:
                continue
            seen.add(thing)
            if M.get(thing) == 9:
                ans += 1
                continue
            for pos, val in M.neighbors(thing):
                if val == M.get(thing) + 1:
                    new_bfs.append(pos)
        bfs = new_bfs

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

If you pay close attention, this is what I literally coded in the first place. Once I realized this, I quite literally undid the small change I made a few seconds ago and managed to get Part 2 in just 34 seconds. Nice!

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from helpers.matrix import *

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

M = from_grid(din, data_type=int)
trailheads = M.findall(0)
ans = 0

for head in trailheads:
    bfs = [head]
    while bfs:
        new_bfs = []
        for thing in bfs:
            if M.get(thing) == 9:
                ans += 1
                continue
            for pos, val in M.neighbors(thing):
                if val == M.get(thing) + 1:
                    new_bfs.append(pos)
        bfs = new_bfs

aocd_submit(ans)
```
