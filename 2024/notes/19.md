Cool problem! Again thought I was fast but not enough. 3rd and 3rd in NJIT.

## Part 1

Super proud of this solution cause it uses regular expressions! I initially had an issue because the greedy regular expressions were eating up some matches that made future natches impossible... so I sorted the matches by longest length first.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import re

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

patterns = sorted(din[0].split(", "), key=lambda x: -len(x))
designs = din[2:]

regex = f"({'|'.join(patterns)})+"

impossible = 0
for design in designs:
    impossible += 1 if re.fullmatch(regex, design) is None else 0

aocd_submit(len(designs) - impossible)
```

## Part 2

This one took me long because I spent too much time looking into the ability of regular expressions to list all overlapping possible ways of matching.

Then eventually I decided to just implement a recursive solution, and it was running very slowly. I started printing some stuff out and then I saw that multiple of the same prefixes were coming up over and over again, so I realized once a certain prefix was reached a second time, that we could just recall the number of ways to get to the end, very efficiently memoizing the problem away! A good thing too, since the number at the end was absolutely humongous.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

patterns = sorted(din[0].split(", "), key=lambda x: len(x))
designs = din[2:]


def make_design(curr, design, avail, seen):
    if curr in seen:
        return seen[curr]

    if curr == design:
        return 1

    tot = 0
    for n in avail:
        if design.startswith(curr + n):
            tot += make_design(curr + n, design, avail, seen)
    seen[curr] = tot
    return tot


ans = 0
for i, design in enumerate(designs):
    ans += make_design("", design, patterns, dict())

aocd_submit(ans)
```
