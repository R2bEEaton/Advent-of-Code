# Day 3 - Mull It Over

> [<- Yesterday](2.md) | [Tomorrow ->](4.md)

I felt like I did this one pretty fast, am still going for leaderboard but I guess it wasn't fast enough. Maybe it's because I was talking on stream.

|        | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total |

| Time   | 3:05   | 5:20   | 8:25  |
| Points | 0      | 0      | 0     |

## Part 1

I quickly identified this would be easily solved with a regular expression, and created it with a couple of typos, which caused me some time. And not thinking to convert to integers.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import re

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)
ans = 0

for mul in re.findall(r'mul\(\d{1,3},\d{1,3}\)', din):
    ans += int(re.findall(r'(\d+)', mul)[0]) * int(re.findall(r'(\d+)', mul)[1])

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

Honestly I was surprised this worked on the first try. What I did was go from the beginning to the first `don't()` then start again at the next `do()` and so on until the end.

> [!WARNING]
> I believe this code fails if the input ends in an "un-closed" `do()`. It seems mine didn't, so I got lucky. My code will not consider multiplications at the end of the string if the last relevant thing was a `do()`.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import re

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)
ans = 0

i = 0
while i < len(din) and i != -1:
    for mul in re.findall(r'mul\(\d{1,3},\d{1,3}\)', din[i:din.find("don't()", i)]):
        ans += int(re.findall(r'(\d+)', mul)[0]) * int(re.findall(r'(\d+)', mul)[1])
    i = din.find("do()", din.find("don't()", i))

aocd_submit(ans)
```
