# Day 7 - Bridge Repair

> [<- Yesterday](6.md) | [Tomorrow ->](8.md)

Frist place in NJIT for Part 1, but Part 2 was very bad bad.

|      | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total     |

## Part 1

A quickly coded slow solution. Hope it doesn't come back to bite me in Part 2!

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from itertools import product

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)
ans = 0

ops = ["+", "*"]

for line in din:
    eq = line[1:]
    for perm in product(ops, repeat=len(eq) - 1):
        equation = []
        for i in range(len(eq) - 1):
            equation.append(str(eq[i]))
            if len(equation) == 3:
                equation = [eval("".join([str(x) for x in equation]))]
            equation.append(perm[i])
        equation.append(str(eq[-1]))
        if eval("".join([str(x) for x in equation])) == line[0]:
            ans += line[0]
            break

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

> [!WARNING]
> BAD CODE. BAD CODE ALERT. THIS IS BAD CODE. IT TAKES 10+ MINUTES TO RUN AND I'M NOT PROUD OF IT BUT IT GOT THE JOB DONE :) This is $O(n) = 3^{n-1} (n-1)$ at its finest.

While my code was running, I looked at spoilers in the NJIT chat, so in the interest of fairness I let it complete. My brain wasn't coming up with the better solution anyway.

For future reference, the better solution is to run a DFS (easily implemented in a recursive form), resulting in the much better:

```math
O(n) = 3 \frac{(1 - 3^n)}{(1 - 3)}
```

Edit: Oh no, it's worse. My bruteforce would have been FINE except for using strings. Joining, concatenating, etc. strings was slowing down my code. So even though my O(n) is only a couple orders of magnitude worse than the better version (they still grow at the same rate), the strings were adding a really bad constant time delay that made it much much worse. [Keeping the same code but removing the dependency on strings](../code/day7c.py), it takes only a minute to run! Learned a lot and had fun analyzing it with [Jonah and going over his solution](https://github.com/engjonah/advent_of_code/tree/main/2024/day07/b.py).

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from itertools import product

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)
ans = 0


def evaluate(eq):
    if eq[1] == "||":
        return [str(eq[0]) + str(eq[2])]
    return [eval("".join([str(x) for x in equation]))]


bad = []
ops = ["+", "*"]

for line in din:
    eq = line[1:]
    for perm in product(ops, repeat=len(eq) - 1):
        equation = []
        for i in range(len(eq) - 1):
            equation.append(str(eq[i]))
            if len(equation) == 3:
                equation = [eval("".join([str(x) for x in equation]))]
            equation.append(perm[i])
        equation.append(str(eq[-1]))
        if eval("".join([str(x) for x in equation])) == line[0]:
            ans += line[0]
            break
    else:
        bad.append(line)

ops = ["+", "*", "||"]

for n, line in enumerate(bad):
    eq = line[1:]
    for perm in product(ops, repeat=len(eq) - 1):
        equation = []
        for i in range(len(eq) - 1):
            equation.append(str(eq[i]))
            if len(equation) == 3:
                equation = evaluate(equation)
                if int(equation[0]) > line[0]:
                    break
            equation.append(perm[i])
        equation.append(str(eq[-1]))
        if int(evaluate(equation)[0]) == line[0]:
            ans += line[0]
            break

aocd_submit(ans)
```
