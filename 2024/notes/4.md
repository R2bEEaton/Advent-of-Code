Ok I quit the leaderboard... This is nuts. 1:30 for part 1, are you kidding me!? I need to get a lot better at speed coding. 2016 and 2017 had me tricked into thinking I was a speed coder.

## Part 1

Typing out all the directions was not my smartest play, but this is fine. This wasn't helped at all by my Matrix class and it was slower to type up anyway. Should have just done a nested list comprehension smh.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from helpers.matrix import Matrix

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
ans = 0

M = Matrix((len(din), len(din[0])))

for y in range(len(din)):
    for x in range(len(din[0])):
        M[(y, x)] = din[y][x]

dirs = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, -1)]

for y in range(len(din)):
    for x in range(len(din[0])):
        for dir in dirs:
            build = ""
            for i in range(4):
                n_char = M[(y+dir[0]*i,x+dir[1]*i)]
                if n_char != None:
                    build += M[(y+dir[0]*i,x+dir[1]*i)]
                else:
                    break
            if build == "XMAS":
                ans += 1

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

Fumbled a bit with the patterns here. A typo was producing SAS and MAM. Not my best work, we'll get 'em next time!

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from helpers.matrix import Matrix

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
ans = 0

M = Matrix((len(din), len(din[0])))

for y in range(len(din)):
    for x in range(len(din[0])):
        M[(y, x)] = din[y][x]

patterns = [
    ['S S',
     ' A ',
     'M M'],

    ['M S',
     ' A ',
     'M S'],

    ['M M',
     ' A ',
     'S S'],

    ['S M',
     ' A ',
     'S M']
]

for y in range(len(din)):
    for x in range(len(din[0])):
        for pat in patterns:
            tot = 0
            for dy in range(3):
                build = ""
                for dx in range(3):
                    if dx == 1 and dy in [0, 2]:
                        build += ' '
                        continue
                    elif dx in [0, 2] and dy == 1:
                        build += ' '
                        continue
                    next_c = M[(y+dy,x+dx)]
                    if next_c != None:
                        build += M[(y+dy,x+dx)]
                    else:
                        break
                if build == pat[dy]:
                    tot += 1
            if tot == 3:
                ans += 1

aocd_submit(ans)
```
