# Day 23 - LAN Party

Graph algorithms. I slept through this one entirely. I was sick and went to bed at 22:15 with an alarm on my phone, and I didn't even hear it. I woke up at 5:30 with a start, and thought "oh well" and went back to sleep until work.

## Problem Summary

Given a set of computer connections, get the number of 3 interconnected triples of computers that contain at least one computer name that starts with the letter `t`.

For Part 2, get the largest set of fully interconnected computers and list the computer names in alphabetical order separated by commas.

## Part 1

For this one, I did a BFS path algorithm with the constraint that the path needs to be 3 long and end in the same node that it started. This would be a fully connected set of 3 computers for sure, and then all to do is see if it has a computer starting with `t` in it.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import networkx

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

G = networkx.Graph()

for line in din:
    a, b = line.split("-")
    G.add_edge(a, b)


def get_paths(start, goal, cost, G):
    q = [[start]]
    paths = set()
    while q:
        path = q.pop(0)
        curr = path[-1]

        if len(path) > cost:
            continue

        for nei in G.neighbors(curr):
            if nei == goal and len(path) == 3:
                paths.add(tuple(sorted(path)))
                continue
            if nei in path:
                continue
            q.append(path + [nei])
    return paths


tot = set()
for n in G:
    if not n.startswith('t'):
        continue
    tot |= get_paths(n, n, 4, G)

aocd_submit(len(tot))
```

## Part 2

This one was super simple. It was more obvious that this was just a graph algorithm that I didn't know, so I did some searching online and about `networkx`. The term I was using was "fully connected subgraph" and I quickly found the [Clique Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem) and that `networkx` has a method `find_cliques()`. Then I could just get the biggest one and sort the nodes alphabetically and join with commas.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import networkx as nx

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

G = nx.Graph()

for line in din:
    a, b = line.split("-")
    G.add_edge(a, b)

cliques = nx.find_cliques(G)
largest = max(cliques, key=len)

aocd_submit(",".join(sorted(largest)))
```
