# Day 25 - Code Chronicle

> [<- Yesterday](24.md) | ~~Tomorrow ->~~

It's over! An amazing 10 year anniversary and this was the first year that I've done every problem within a day and without any hints at all! I hope I am still at a stage of my life next year in which I can sacrifice a month of sleep for this, because it's so fun for me!

## Problem Summary

Given a set of key and lock shapes, check how many valid key-lock pairs there are. The key doesn't have to mesh exactly with the lock, it just needs to fit inside with no overlapping areas.

## Part 1

Nothing really noteable except for making use of `np.transpose` to turn the lock on its side so I could more easily count the `#` area of the locks and keys. Then to check if they didn't overlap, I could just make sure the sum of the key/lock column was less than 5 (since I cut off the flat ends of the key and lock).

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import numpy as np

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

keys = []
locks = []

for i in range(0, len(din), 8):
    line = din[i:i+7]
    if line[0].count("#") == 5:
        line = [[x for x in y] for y in line]
        line = np.transpose(line)
        lock_heights = [np.count_nonzero(x == "#") - 1 for x in line]
        locks.append(lock_heights)
    else:
        line = [[x for x in y] for y in reversed(line)]
        line = np.transpose(line)
        key_heights = [np.count_nonzero(x == "#") - 1 for x in line]
        keys.append(key_heights)

ans = 0
for key in keys:
    for lock in locks:
        if np.max(np.add(key, lock)) <= 5:
            ans += 1

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

I don't know what to tell you... I clicked the button!

Again, super fun year and I can't WAIT until next year!
