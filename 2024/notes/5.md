Yikes. I am going to be silently removing points from these tables.

|        | Part 1 | Part 2  | Total   |

## Part 1

Ok, I am decently sort of ish proud of how fast I came up with this one. I wish I did some more investigation into the input though, as it turns out that `N choose 2` before and after pairs are given in both the example and real inputs, so there's no guesswork based on some transitive property required. So a lot of this code is unnecessary, but works fine of course.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from collections import defaultdict

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)
ans = 0

after = defaultdict(list)
before = defaultdict(list)
in_rules = True


def valid(line):
    for i, x in enumerate(line):
        print(i, x)
        for y in line[i+1:]:
            if y in before[x]:
                return False
        for y in line[:i]:
            if y in after[x]:
                return False
    return True


for line in din:
    if len(line) == 0:
        in_rules = False
        continue
    
    if in_rules:
        after[line[0]].append(line[1])
        before[line[1]].append(line[0])
        continue
    
    if valid(line):
        ans += line[len(line) // 2]

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

This is the YIKES part. I completed it on my own which is good, but it took a long time and I finished it last among all the main competitors in the NJIT leaderboard. First, the slow realization that all `N choose 2` rules were accounted for, then I needed to just sort... I looked briefly into sorting based on a compare function which would have been super easy, but I saw that Python had removed the ability to do so. So I ~~did~~ stole a bubble sort algorithm. THEN my biggest mistake was trying to sort all the numbers from the rules, which I don't think is possible, at least for my input. Curiously, it works for the example input. I was going to use this sorted array of numbers and their indices as a key to sort the incorrectly-ordered updates. I SHOULD HAVE JUST TRIED TO SORT THE BAD UPDATES USING MY FUNCTIONAL BUBBLE SORT FROM THE GET-GO.

This one was BAD. My worldwide rank is well over 10,000. And now I'm going to bed way too late. And I'm not happy. And I lost first place in another private leaderboard, to a guy that did both parts in about, I don't know, 6 minutes. And, as TJ from the NJIT Private Leaderboard has in his code, [this would have been easily solveable if I knew about the `cmp_to_key` function which makes me very sad :(](https://github.com/TJThePiGuy/AdventOfCode/blob/main/2024/notes/05.md). And it's late, did I mention that?

But in all seriousness, it's a privilege to be able to do something like this and I am proud of myself for being on the right track for a decent chunk of it. But then there's that voice that says "what if I was just a better programmer." Maybe next year, maybe next year.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from collections import defaultdict

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)
ans = 0
after = defaultdict(set)
in_rules = True
unique_nums = set()


def valid(line):
    for i, x in enumerate(line):
        for y in line[:i]:
            if y in after[x]:
                return False
    return True


bad = []

for line in din:
    if len(line) == 0:
        in_rules = False
        continue
    
    if in_rules:
        after[line[0]].add(line[1])
        unique_nums.add(line[0])
        continue
    
    if not valid(line):
        bad.append(line)

def bubble_sort(arr):
    for n in range(len(arr) - 1, 0, -1):
        swapped = False
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] in after[arr[i+1]]:
                arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
                swapped = True
        if not swapped:
            break


for thing in bad:
    bubble_sort(thing)
    ans += thing[len(thing) // 2]

aocd_submit(ans)
```
