# Day 16 - Reindeer Maze

> [<- Yesterday](15.md) | [Tomorrow ->](17.md)

I did ok for Part 1, finishing 3rd in NJIT and then 2nd for Part 2. Part 2 is ugly though.

|      | Part 1 | Part 2  | Total       |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Time | 18:44  | 1:06:11 | Σ = 1:24:55 |
| Rank | 1178   | 2496    | μ = 1837    |

## Problem Summary

Given a maze, you have a starting position and direction and a goal to reach. Going forward adds one 1 score, rotating 90 degrees increases your score by 1000. The objective for Part 1 is to determine the lowest score possible to reach the goal. Then in Part 2, you must determine the number of unique locations you can visit on any valid path to the goal (there may be more than one path to the goal).

## Part 1

This was a simple special case of BFS with priority queue (also known as A-Star) in which the lowest cost paths are explored first, such that longer paths can be disregarded later. Doing this comes up with the solution very quickly, which is just the lowest score to reach the goal. It took me a little longer since I had a bug where I was only adding 1000 when making a turn, but since I combined rotating and moving forward into one step for corners, that should have been 1001 (1 rotation and 1 forward).

```python
from helpers.matrix import DIRS_URDL, from_grid
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import heapq

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

M = from_grid(din)

q = []
heapq.heappush(q, (0, (*M.findall("S")[0], 1)))
best_cost = float('inf')
seen = set()

while q:
    cost, curr = heapq.heappop(q)
    pos = curr[:2]

    if curr in seen:
        continue
    seen.add(curr)

    if cost >= best_cost:
        continue

    if M.get(pos) == "E":
        best_cost = min(best_cost, cost)
        continue

    for d in [(curr[2] + 1) % 4, curr[2], (curr[2] - 1) % 4]:
        new_pos = tuple(pos[i] + DIRS_URDL[d][i] for i in range(2))
        if M.get(new_pos) in ".E":
            heapq.heappush(q, (cost + (1001 if d != curr[2] else 1), (*new_pos, d)))

aocd_submit(best_cost)
```

## Part 2

This is where I struggled, but still managed to get 2nd place. I instantly dismissed the idea that I could just store each unique path since I figured storing all those position tuples would take a lot of memory or something. So instead I checked from the start position to every possible intermediate position, and then from each intermediate position to the end. If the sum of their scores was equal to the minimum path before, then that intermediate position must be on a minimum path. After some rough optimization of the initial 4+ hour expected runtime, the code took 20 minutes to run, which was enough to get me 2nd but a very dumb way to do it. I took it though because I was not thinking it was possible or efficient to store the paths.

Turns out though, you can just assign an index to each path position and store the path in a big binary number and then bitwise OR all the minimum paths. [Got that from my nemesis TJ, very smart!](https://github.com/TJThePiGuy/AdventOfCode/blob/main/2024/notes/16.md). This would make a 1 appear at any index that is on one ore more of the many minimum paths to the goal, and you can just count how many 1s there are to get the answer!

from helpers.matrix import DIRS_URDL, from_grid
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import heapq
import tqdm

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

M = from_grid(din)


def get_lowest_cost(start, goal, best):
    q = []
    heapq.heappush(q, (0, start))
    best_cost = float('inf')
    best_dir = -1
    seen = set()

    while q:
        cost, curr = heapq.heappop(q)
        pos = curr[:2]

        if curr in seen:
            continue
        seen.add(curr)

        if cost >= best_cost or cost > best:
            continue

        if (*pos, curr[2]) == goal or (pos[:2] == goal[:2] and goal[2] < 0):
            best_cost = min(best_cost, cost)
            best_dir = curr[2]
            continue

        for d in {(curr[2] + 1) % 4, curr[2], (curr[2] - 1) % 4}:
            new_pos = tuple(pos[i] + DIRS_URDL[d][i] for i in range(2))
            if M.get(new_pos) in {".", "E"}:
                heapq.heappush(q, (cost + (1001 if d != curr[2] else 1), (*new_pos, d)))

    return best_cost, best_dir, seen

best, _, seen = get_lowest_cost((*M.findall("S")[0], 1), (*M.findall("E")[0], -1), float('inf'))
ans = 0

for intermediate in tqdm.tqdm(set([loc[:2] for loc in seen])):
    S_i, bd, _ = get_lowest_cost((*M.findall("S")[0], 1), (*intermediate, -1), best)
    i_E, _, _ = get_lowest_cost((*intermediate, bd), (*M.findall("E")[0], -1), best - S_i)
    ans += S_i + i_E == best

aocd_submit(ans)
```
