# Day 1 - Historian Hysteria

> ~~<- Yesterday~~ | [Tomorrow ->](2.md)

MY POOR HEART RIGHT NOW. I got in the global leaderboard once ever, it was last year on Day 2, Part 1 for 90th place.

This time I got 42nd and 13th place.

My poor heart right now.

I guess my practice doing [2016](/2016/readme.md) and starting [2017](/2017/readme.md) recently paid off! Based on time I was placing well in those years but I also know a lot fewer people were playing back then. Maybe this was a fluke, we shall see!

|        | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Time   | 1:07   | 0:24   | 1:31  |
| Points | 59     | 88     | 147   |

## Part 1

A great Day 1! Super simple code, made easier by my helper for parsing the usual multiple numbers, multiple lines format.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

left = []
right = []

ans = 0
for line in din:
    left.append(line[0])
    right.append(line[1])

left = sorted(left)
right = sorted(right)

for i in range(len(left)):
    ans += abs(left[i] - right[i])

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

A single line change to multiple the value on the left by the number of times it appears on the right. The sort is now unnecessary but I didn't care. I pretty much SKIMMED the Part 2 prompt and HOPED that it was just that easy, hence 24 seconds. Wowee.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

left = []
right = []

ans = 0
for line in din:
    left.append(line[0])
    right.append(line[1])

left = sorted(left)
right = sorted(right)

for i in range(len(left)):
    ans += left[i] * right.count(left[i])

aocd_submit(ans)
```
