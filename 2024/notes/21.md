## Problem Summary

[Just read the problem...](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/21) It's terrifying! Basically there's a keypad and you need to type a certain sequence. Except you can't access the keypad, so you have a robot with a control pad. You move the robot arm using the control pad in a certain way such that the robot would type the sequence. Except that robot is unreachable, so it's controlled by a robot, and so on and so on. What's the shortest number of button presses to make the original robot type the sequence?

## Part 1

This problem was daunting to code, but not too bad to understand. I figured that all we would need to do was compute the best shortest path from each starting position on each pad to each ending point. There are two cases: the keypad and the number pad. So I did some BFS with path tracing to find the shortest paths, but this ended up not being enough later. It turned out I needed to prioritize paths with fewer turns (because that would mean the robot that came before wouldn't have to switch buttons more than it needed to, and there's always a best path with only 1 turn anyway) and prefer paths that end in `^` or `>` because those are closer to `A`.

Once I had that, it was a matter of connecting the robots together and moving from the robot's previous position to the new position recursively (except I did it iteratively because I was lazy). I had it pretty close for a while, but the biggest problem was scoring the paths like I mentioned above, I had not considered there were better shorter paths until I actually inspected some of the paths given in the example.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from helpers.matrix import from_grid
import re

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

numeric = from_grid('789\n456\n123\n 0A')
directional = from_grid(' ^A\n<v>')


def score_path(path):
    dir_changes = 0
    for i in range(len(path) - 2):
        dir_changes += path[i] != path[i+1]
    dir_changes *= 10
    if len(path) >= 2:
       dir_changes += (3 if path[-2] in "<" else 0) + (2 if path[-2] in "v" else 0) + (1 if path[-2] in "^>" else 0)
    return dir_changes


def shortest_path(nspos, ngpos, out_grid):
    q = [[nspos]]
    paths = []
    parent = {}
    while q:
        path = q.pop(0)
        curr = path[-1]

        if curr == ngpos:
            paths.append(path)
            continue

        for nei, val in out_grid.neighbors(curr):

            if diff == (0, -1):
                path_dirs.append("<")
            elif diff == (0, 1):
                path_dirs.append(">")
            elif diff == (-1, 0):

            elif diff == (1, 0):
                path_dirs.append("v")
        path_dirs.append("A")
        path_dirss.append(path_dirs)

    min_path = min([len(path) for path in path_dirss])
    path_dirss = filter(lambda x: len(x) == min_path, path_dirss)
    path_dirs = sorted(path_dirss, key = lambda x: score_path(x))[0]
    return path_dirs

## Part 2

I had this within 10-20 minutes, but I had this line:

```python
path1 = shortest_paths_dir_to_num[prevs[i], curr]
```

instead of...

```python
path1 = shortest_paths_dir_to_num[prevs[i], curr] if i == 0 else shortest_paths_dir_to_dir[prevs[i], curr]
```

In my recursive solution I had the exact code I needed except I was accidentally using my pre-computed shortest paths from the direction pad to the number pad for every instance of the robot, rather than just the last one, but inexplicably it produced the same answer as Part 1 by chance. I would consider that a typo because I took that into account in Part 1 and in Part 2 for the line before it. Then it was just memoizing the recursive function. We don't even need to store the positions of the later robot arms because everything will end in `A` for each letter on all robots except the last one hovering over the number pad, which will not cause a problem with memoization because that was the first time that case was seen anyway. Now that I think about it, I wonder if there's an issue with multiple of the same number in the desired sequence, but I am not going to worry about that.

In other words, slap a cache on it and don't make typos!
