Yikes. I finished first in Part 1 which had me encouraged for a faster Part 2... but... the global top 100 leaderboard didn't fill up for 45 minutes so there was no way I could get it anytime soon.

## Problem Summary

You are given a program and a set of inputs. For Part 1, the program must be simulated and then your solution is the output of the program. For Part 2 however, you need to determine the smallest input required to generate a very specific output, which is much harder.

## Part 1

This was a fun problem to implement, reminiscent of [IntCode](https://adventofcode.com/2019) and similar problems over the years. Once I implemented the instruction set in Python, it was just a matter of simulating it and accruing the outputs until the program halted.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

regs = {"A": din[0][0], "B": din[1][0], "C": din[2][0]}

IP = 0

program = din[4]
output = []

while IP < len(program):
    opcode = program[IP]
    operand_lit = program[IP+1]
    operand_combo = operand_lit if operand_lit < 4 else regs[chr(ord("A") + operand_lit - 4)]

    if opcode == 0:
        regs["A"] = regs["A"] // (2 ** operand_combo)
    elif opcode == 1:
        regs["B"] ^= operand_lit
    elif opcode == 2:
        regs["B"] = operand_combo % 8
    elif opcode == 3:
        if regs["A"]:
            IP = operand_lit
            IP -= 2
    elif opcode == 4:
        regs["B"] ^= regs["C"]
    elif opcode == 5:
        output.append(operand_combo % 8)
    elif opcode == 6:
        regs["B"] = regs["A"] // (2 ** operand_combo)
    elif opcode == 7:
        regs["C"] = regs["A"] // (2 ** operand_combo)

    IP += 2


aocd_submit(",".join([str(x) for x in output]))
```

## Part 2

This however was the kicker. I realized pretty early on you couldn't just bruteforce this. I started simulating and quickly discovered that my answer would have to be $>= 8^{(16-1)}$ since my program input was 16 characters long. That's a big number.

So the next step, looking at the input! What's this power of 8 business? That's because since the computer works using 3-bit logic (eg. the output is register B mod 8), I figured that each outputted number is dependent on only the 3 least significant bits of whatever happens to be fed into it. So I figured there would be high correlation between any aligned sequence of 3 bits and the number output at that index. Eg. the lowest three bits would probably correspond to the first number outputted and so on. So I wrote a bit of code to test it, and there was, each set of 3 bits would only change 1-3 of the outputted numbers. So I wrote some code to independently find each set of 3-bit that would correspond to a given outputted number. This didn't yield anything.

So I looked at the input and saw that while each number wasn't entirely dependent on its corresponding 3-bit number, I think the max distance away was around 8 bits for influence, just based on how the equation worked for generating outputs. Here are my notes where I started running the program by hand and determined which bits corresponded to each output number.

A much smaller space! for whatever reason, my brain jumped immediately to a genetic algorithm. You could come up with a fitness score like `number of matches / number of outputs` and the crossover would just magically land on the independent sections that influence the answer and just magically know when to stop optimizing them. Because that's what I thought of, by golly, that's what I'd do!

And it was very promising too. For example, I came up with all the following answers (written in binary):

011000000110100110101110001110001111001100001001
```

...except these all produce outputs that differ in exactly 1 place. I am happy to say that my genetic algorithm would totally work, if not for the small caveat that you'd need to get really really lucky. But why did it have to give me false hope like that, getting to 0.9375 fitness after only a few hundred generations! I tried this for longer than I'd like to admit, and tried to find patterns in the almost-solutions. This amazing and correct solution can be viewed for fun [here if you dare](../code/day17c.py).

So I went to bed at 3:00 (I'm in Eastern now by the way) and I stopped thinking about it and the fact that I'd need to wake up in 4 hours and that I hadn't gotten more than 5 hours of sleep in the past 3 days, and... then I worked on it in the morning.

Shockingly similar to my initial experiment where I checked each set of 3-bit numbers to see what they would do. In that initial experiment, I was just checking which numbers `0b000` - `0b111` would result in a certain output when all other 45 bits were 1. However, as can be seen here there is more dependency than that.

```text
011000110001011100101110001110001000111100000001
                                         aaa aaa
                                     bbb  bbb
                                      cccc
                                  ddddd
                            eee  eee
                              ...
```

So, going from the least most significant 3 bits to the lowest, keep track of all the numbers that can result in the corresponding output number, and then... remember those! Then for the next 3 bits, see if the correct output is still preserved, and so on until a set of valid inputs remains, then pick the smallest one. That is over-simplifying it, but it relied heavily on hours and hours of observation and testing how my input program worked for me to finally come up with it. And then it was similar to what I did initially, of course. In all, I probably spent 5 hours on this problem. Fun stuff! You can also see in the code remnants of the genetic algorithm language.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

program = din[4]


def to_bin(l):
    o = 0
    for i in range(len(l)):
        o |= l[len(l) - 1 - i] << i
    return o


def checkA(A_val):
    regs = {"A": A_val, "B": din[1][0], "C": din[2][0]}
    IP = 0

    program = din[4]
    output = []

    while IP < len(program):
        opcode = program[IP]
        operand_lit = program[IP+1]
        operand_combo = operand_lit if operand_lit < 4 else regs[chr(ord("A") + operand_lit - 4)]

        if opcode == 0:
            regs["A"] = regs["A"] // (2 ** operand_combo)
        elif opcode == 1:
            regs["B"] ^= operand_lit
        elif opcode == 2:
            regs["B"] = operand_combo % 8
        elif opcode == 3:
            if regs["A"]:
                IP = operand_lit
                IP -= 2
        elif opcode == 4:
            regs["B"] ^= regs["C"]
        elif opcode == 5:
            return operand_combo % 8
        elif opcode == 6:
            regs["B"] = regs["A"] // (2 ** operand_combo)
        elif opcode == 7:
            regs["C"] = regs["A"] // (2 ** operand_combo)

        IP += 2
    return


population = [0]
for tri in range(len(program)):
    print(population)
    new_population = []
    for pop in population:
        for i in range(8):
            A = pop * 8 + i
            if checkA(A) == program[len(program)-1-tri]:
                new_population.append(A)
    population = new_population

aocd_submit(min(population))
```
