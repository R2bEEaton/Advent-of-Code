## Part 1

This was a simple problem that took me too long since I was using my helper. Sounds familiar. I need to make better helpers. Loading a 2d grid of characters into my thing is way too cumbersone to be helpful, and it's a very common process. Variables from helper files for directions and stuff too. Someone remind me to do that one of these days. Got 4th for both stars in NJIT.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from helpers.matrix import Matrix

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

M = Matrix((len(din), len(din[0])))
ans = 0

for y in range(len(din)):
    for x in range(len(din[0])):
        M[(y, x)] = din[y][x]
        if din[y][x] == "^":
            pos = [y, x]

dir = 0
dirs = [
    (-1, 0),
    (0, 1),
    (1, 0),
    (0, -1)
]

seen = set([tuple(pos)])

while M[pos]:
    forward = [pos[0] + dirs[dir][0], pos[1] + dirs[dir][1]]
    if M[forward] == "#":
        dir += 1
        dir %= 4
    else:
        pos = forward
        M[pos] = "X"
    seen.add(tuple(pos))

aocd_submit(len(seen) - 1)
```

## Part 2

Yeah, I just bruteforced every single position for a new obstacle. Fortunately the guard starting position wasn't one, because I forgot to ignore that. Here I'll add it into the code for completeness.

I am working on a better solution. I think the pattern is related to 3 existing obstacles that would form a square if only it had one more corner. For example:

```
.#....
.+--+#
#^--+.
....O.
```

As far as I checked, every case in the example follows that. Then maybe some filtering to make sure the guy would have gotten on that path, or just check the substantially fewer cases.

Another option I just yoinked / modified from [Jonah's](https://github.com/engjonah/) private livestream he doesn't know I'm still watching, you could just check the path itself! Genius. He stopped the bruteforce solution and came up with that which was very smart since the new barrier would obviously have to be on the old path, only have to think about that for a little bit to convince yourself why. Good job Jonah! Maybe my Part 3 isn't worth continuing.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from helpers.matrix import Matrix
import copy

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
M = Matrix((len(din), len(din[0])))
ans = 0

for y in range(len(din)):
    for x in range(len(din[0])):
        M[(y, x)] = din[y][x]
        if din[y][x] == "^":
            pos = [y, x]

dirs = [
    (-1, 0),
    (0, 1),
    (1, 0),
    (0, -1)
]


def loops(obstruction, pos):
    dir = 0
    N = copy.deepcopy(M)
    N[obstruction] = "#"
    seen = set([tuple([*pos, dir])])
    while N[pos]:
        forward = [pos[0] + dirs[dir][0], pos[1] + dirs[dir][1]]
        if N[forward] == "#":
            dir += 1
            dir %= 4
        else:
            pos = forward
        if tuple([*pos, dir]) in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(tuple([*pos, dir]))
    return False


for y in range(len(din)):
    for x in range(len(din[0])):
        if [y, x] == pos:
            continue
        if loops((y, x), pos):
            ans += 1

aocd_submit(ans)
```
