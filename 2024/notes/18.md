# Day 18 - RAM Run

> [<- Yesterday](17.md) | [Tomorrow ->](19.md)

Pretty quick, but not quick enough for NJIT. I got 3rd and 2nd.

|      | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total     |
|------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Time | 17:05  | 8:55   | Σ = 26:00 |
| Rank | 1860   | 1926   | μ = 1893  |

## Part 1

Just a matter of implemeting a BFS. I used a priority queue in anticipation of a Part 2 but there was no heuristic for Part 1 so it ended up just being BFS. I lost a lot of time because I thought the bytes were falling and corrupting positions at each time interval. I didn't read or pick up on the fact that Part 1 was asking for *after* 1024 bytes fell. I thought they were falling while you were moving through the maze. That would have been cool! However, due to this incorrect thought, it led me to set up the grid with each position being the time index that it gets corrupted, which was helpful for Part 2.

```python
import heapq
from helpers.matrix import DIRS_URDL, Matrix
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

M = Matrix((71, 71))

for t, line in enumerate(din):
    M.set((line[1], line[0]), t + 1)

q = []
heapq.heappush(q, (0, (0, 0, 0)))
best_cost = float('inf')
seen = set()

while q:
    cost, curr = heapq.heappop(q)
    pos = curr[:2]
    t = curr[2]

    if curr in seen:
        continue
    seen.add(curr)

    if cost > best_cost:
        continue

    if 0 < M.get(pos) <= 1024:
        continue

    if pos == (70, 70):
        best_cost = min(best_cost, cost)
        continue

    for nei, val in M.neighbors(pos):
        if val is None:
            continue
        heapq.heappush(q, (cost + 1, (*nei, t + 1)))

aocd_submit(best_cost)
```

## Part 2

Thankfully what I set up in Part 1 incorrectly did end up coming in handy. Rather than initializing the array over and over or doing some checking in the input, I already had a grid with the time index that positions became corrupted. So I could just treat anything `0 < pos_time <= after_time` as a wall (where 0 is my grid default "open" value).

In lieu of bruteforce checking, I realized I could just check every thousand manually and see where it gets cut off, then narrow my search range until I found it. I did this manually with print statements calling my function with different values. I lost 2 minutes due to two wrong submissions. First I submitted the index of the position, and then I submitted the position of the byte *after* the one in question.

After solving it by hand, I added a silly while statement to check for the solution so that my code is actually complete. I don't feel like revisiting and writing an automatic range-dividing checker. I'm writing these notes 8 minutes before the next Day, so I seriously don't have time for that.

```python
import heapq
from helpers.matrix import DIRS_URDL, Matrix
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

M = Matrix((71, 71))

for t, line in enumerate(din):
    M.set((line[1], line[0]), t + 1)


def check_after(X):
    q = []
    heapq.heappush(q, (0, (0, 0, 0)))
    best_cost = float('inf')
    seen = set()

    while q:
        cost, curr = heapq.heappop(q)
        pos = curr[:2]
        t = curr[2]

        if pos in seen:
            continue
        seen.add(pos)

        if cost > best_cost:
            continue

        if 0 < M.get(pos) <= X:
            continue

        if pos == (70, 70):
            best_cost = min(best_cost, cost)
            continue

        for nei, val in M.neighbors(pos):
            if val is None:
                continue
            heapq.heappush(q, (cost + 1, (*nei, t + 1)))

    return best_cost != float('inf')


# Wasn't actually solved like this, I did it by spot checking 2000 and 3000 and noticed it got blocked between that, so I kept lowering the range until I found it.
# I could code this up but I want to go to bed, so I just put it like this for completeness.
x = 0
while check_after(x):
    x += 1

aocd_submit(",".join([str(i) for i in din[x-1]]))
```
