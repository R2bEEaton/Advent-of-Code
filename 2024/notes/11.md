# Day 11 - Plutonian Pebbles

> [<- Yesterday](10.md) | [Tomorrow ->](12.md)

I felt like I did it fast, but I was over 1,000 for both parts globally. Oh well. 5th and 2nd for NJIT, excluding the (probably AI) anonymous user.

## Problem Summary

This is a problem about rules that turn certain numbers into certain other numbers. For example if the number is 0, replace it with 1. If the number has an even number of digits, replace it with the first half of the number AND the second half of the number, removing leading zeroes. Otherwise, multiply the number by 2024. The goal for Part 1 was to count the number of numbers after running the rules 25 times. Then for Part 2, run the rules for 75.

## Part 1

For Part 1, I simply implemented the rules, and it only produced a list of about 200,000 numbers by the end, so it was manageable to compute and runs in under a second on my machine. Unfortunately I typed 22 instead of 25, which cost me a minute of waiting for the website to let me submit the correct answer, which might have put me in first in NJIT, oh well.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=True)
din = din[0]

stones = din

for _ in range(25):
    new_stones = []
    for stone in stones:
        stone_str = str(stone)
        if stone == 0:
            new_stones.append(1)
        elif len(stone_str) % 2 == 0:
            new_stones.append(int(stone_str[:len(stone_str) // 2]))
            new_stones.append(int(stone_str[len(stone_str) // 2:]))
        else:
            new_stones.append(stone * 2024)
    stones = new_stones
    
aocd_submit(len(new_stones))
```

## Part 2

This was a very common Advent of Code twist, making the naive solution take hundreds of years to finish on Part 2, just by increasing the number of steps from 25 to 75.

For this, I happily picked the right solution and quickly switched the code into a recurisve form and memoized based on stone number and the remaning number of steps. We don't care what the numbers actually end up being or what order they're in, we only care *how many there are*. So, whenever we see a certain number at a certain number of steps remaining, we can just save the result. So I made it recursive, cached the function inputs and outputs using `functools` `@cache` decorator, upped the step count, and it now runs even quicker than Part 1!

*A good thing too, since I don't have a thousand years or terabytes of memory... if only...*

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from functools import cache

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=True)
din = din[0]

stones = din
ans = 0

seen = {}


@cache
def get_nums(stone, depth):
    if depth == 0:
        return 1

    new_stones = []
    tot = 0
    stone_str = str(stone)
    if stone == 0:
        new_stones.append(1)
    elif len(stone_str) % 2 == 0:
        new_stones.append(int(stone_str[:len(stone_str) // 2]))
        new_stones.append(int(stone_str[len(stone_str) // 2:]))
    else:
        new_stones.append(stone * 2024)
    
    for new_stone in new_stones:
        tot += get_nums(new_stone, depth-1)

    return tot
    

for num in stones:
    ans += get_nums(num, 75)

aocd_submit(ans)
```
