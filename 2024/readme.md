# Ryan Eaton's Advent of Code 2024

A repository to store my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

**This year is being completed syncronously. Yipee!**

Solutions will be slightly refactored for readability before submission. In other words...

```diff
+ Refactor to remove unused code
- No logic changes allowed
- No fixing the stupid or unnecessary checks I wrote
+ Code must produce valid solutions
```

I'm going for speed. This repository is not an example of good code. It won't be pretty.

## Times and Things

This is pretty much a table of contents for my solution times and equivalent points.

| Title                                   | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total | Points |
|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| [Day 1: Historian Hysteria](notes/1.md) | 1:07   | 0:24   | 1:31  | 147    |
| [Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports](notes/2.md)  | 7:47   | 1:40   | 9:27  | 0      |
