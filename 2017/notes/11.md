# Day 11 - Hex Ed

This was a very unique puzzle idea, I liked it a lot. I had to reference some material for hexagonal coordinates though!

|        | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Time   | 9:20   | 0:22   | 9:42  |
| Points | 0      | 40     | 40    |

## Part 1

I immediately took to Googling a good hexagonal coordinate system. I was originally going to use the angles themselves to move in 2d space, but then I realized extracting the distance back out of that would have been hard, or beyond my immediate reasoning. So I found [this article](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) supremely helpful, particularly the Cube Coordinates and Distances sections.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

dirs = {
    "ne": (0, -1, 1),
    "n": (-1, 0, 1),
    "nw": (-1, 1, 0),
    "sw": (0, 1, -1),
    "s": (1, 0, -1),
    "se": (1, -1, 0)
}

pos = [0, 0, 0]


def cube_dist(a):
    return (abs(a[0]) + abs(a[1]) + abs(a[2])) / 2


for move in din.split(","):
    dir = dirs[move]
    pos[0] += dir[0]
    pos[1] += dir[1]
    pos[2] += dir[2]

aocd_submit(int(cube_dist(pos)))
```

## Part 2

Once I had that, it was simple to just keep track of each distance reached and return the max.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

dirs = {
    "ne": (0, -1, 1),
    "n": (-1, 0, 1),
    "nw": (-1, 1, 0),
    "sw": (0, 1, -1),
    "s": (1, 0, -1),
    "se": (1, -1, 0)
}

pos = [0, 0, 0]


def cube_dist(a):
    return (abs(a[0]) + abs(a[1]) + abs(a[2])) / 2


max_dist = 0
for move in din.split(","):
    dir = dirs[move]
    pos[0] += dir[0]
    pos[1] += dir[1]
    pos[2] += dir[2]
    max_dist = max(max_dist, int(cube_dist(pos)))


aocd_submit(max_dist)
```
