# Day 7 - Recursive Circus

> [<- Yesterday](6.md) | [Tomorrow ->](8.md)

Another really cool problem! I didn't even look at the name and used recursion haha. Pretty fast!

## Part 1

I created a dictionary of discs and what is supporting it. Anything remaining would be the bottom disc.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

supported_by = {}

for line in din:
    if line.split()[0] not in supported_by:
        supported_by[line.split()[0]] = ""
    if "-" not in line:
        continue
    for on in line.split('-> ')[1].split(", "):
        supported_by[on] = line.split()[0]

for disc, supp in supported_by.items():
    if supp == "":
        aocd_submit(disc)
        break
```

## Part 2

Using this supported by dictionary, I reversed it and made a dictionary of supporting. What is this disc *supporting*. Then I used recursion to compute the total weight of the current node. Starting at the bottom, go recursively down each branch and whenever the children are different, that means the child node with a different weight from the others is the one that should change to balance it.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

supported_by = {}
weights = {}

for line in din:
    weights[line.split()[0]] = int(line.split("(")[1].split(")")[0])
    if line.split()[0] not in supported_by:
        supported_by[line.split()[0]] = ""
    if "-" not in line:
        continue
    for on in line.split('-> ')[1].split(", "):
        supported_by[on] = line.split()[0]

from collections import defaultdict
supports = defaultdict(list)
for disc, supp in supported_by.items():
    supports[supp].append(disc)

start = supports[''][0]

def recurse(disc):
    if len(supports[disc]) == 0:
        return weights[disc]
    
    out = []
    for child in supports[disc]:
        out.append(recurse(child))

    if min(out) != max(out):
        for i, o in enumerate(out):
            if out.count(o) != 1:
                continue
            aocd_submit(weights[supports[disc][i]] - (out[i] - out[(i + 1) % len(out)]))
        exit()

    return weights[disc] + sum(out)

recurse(start)
       

```
