# Day 6 - Memory Reallocation

Cool puzzle! Just bruteforced it. Probably had to, right? There's no way.

|        | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Time   | 7:27   | 0:47   | 8:14  |
| Points | 0      | 44     | 44    |

## Part 1

A "just do it" type of problem. I made a function for it and kept track of seen states in a set.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=True)
curr = din[0]

seen = set()

def evolve(curr):
    idx = curr.index(max(curr))
    target = curr[idx]
    curr[idx] = 0

    for i in range(1, target + 1):
        curr[(idx + i) % len(curr)] += 1

    return curr

tot = 0
while tuple(curr) not in seen:
    seen.add(tuple(curr))
    curr = evolve(curr)
    tot += 1

aocd_submit(tot)
```

## Part 2

Quick modification to start the same exact process over again after the cycle start was found. Just a copy and paste!

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=True)
curr = din[0]

seen = set()

def evolve(curr):
    idx = curr.index(max(curr))
    target = curr[idx]
    curr[idx] = 0

    for i in range(1, target + 1):
        curr[(idx + i) % len(curr)] += 1

    return curr

tot = 0
while tuple(curr) not in seen:
    seen.add(tuple(curr))
    curr = evolve(curr)
    tot += 1

seen.clear()
tot = 0
while tuple(curr) not in seen:
    seen.add(tuple(curr))
    curr = evolve(curr)
    tot += 1

aocd_submit(tot)
```
