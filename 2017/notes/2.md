# Day 2 - Corruption Checksum

> [<- Yesterday](1.md) | [Tomorrow ->](3.md)

Super easy, really good times I think.

|        | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Time   | 0:38   | 1:52   | 2:30  |
| Points | 99     | 91     | 190   |

## Part 1

I typed this super fast, benefited by my helpers a lot. I didn't even test it, just subimtted it! This equates to 2nd place in 2017.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

tot = 0
for line in din:
    tot += max(line) - min(line)

aocd_submit(tot)
```

## Part 2

Had it coded instantly but the example changed, so that threw me off. I kept getting `1` as a valid divisor in the input (obviously) but turns out there was a new input and no `1`'s in the real input! Equates to 10th place.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

tot = 0
for line in din:
    for x in line:
        for y in line:
            if x == y:
                continue
            if x % y == 0:
                tot += x / y

aocd_submit(tot)
```
