# Day 4 - High-Entropy Passphrase

> [<- Yesterday](3.md) | [Tomorrow ->](5.md)

Super fast I think! Ok I thought this was going to be top 10 for both but it wasn't. Oh wel..

|        | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Time   | 1:20   | 1:05   | 2:25  |
| Points | 57     | 61     | 118   |

## Part 1

Simple solution, just count instances of each word in each line and used the lesser-known `for ... else` block to detect when nothing was returned. Worked first try!

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

tot = 0
for line in din:
    words = line.split()
    for word in words:
        if words.count(word) > 1:
            break
    else:
        tot += 1

aocd_submit(tot)
```

## Part 2

Very similar solution, simply just sorted the letters of each word to make anagrams equivalent.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

tot = 0
for line in din:
    words = ["".join(sorted(list(x))) for x in line.split()]
    for word in words:
        if words.count(word) > 1:
            break
    else:
        tot += 1

aocd_submit(tot)
```
