# Day 15 - Dueling Generators

> [<- Yesterday](14.md) | [Tomorrow ->](16.md)

Yet another instance of "strings are slow and so am I."

|        | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total   |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Time   | 55:30  | 7:56   | 1:03:26 |
| Points | 0      | 0      | 0       |

## Part 1

My code was running super slow and I had no idea why, so I tried to optimize by looking for cycles and caching, etc. Unfortunately I had to look at hints, and saw that people were checking things bitwise. Duh! Dumb `bin()` function is so tempting though :(.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

factors = [16807, 48271]
rem = 2147483647

A, B = (line[0] for line in din)

ans = 0

for i in range(40_000_000):
    A *= factors[0]
    A %= rem

    B *= factors[1]
    B %= rem

    if A & 0xFFFF == B & 0xFFFF:
        ans += 1

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

Simple change for Part 2 to make the generators only return factors of 4 and 8 respectively.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

factors = [16807, 48271]
rem = 2147483647

A, B = (line[0] for line in din)


def get_next(gen, factor, mult):
    gen *= factor
    gen %= rem
    while gen % mult != 0:
        gen *= factor
        gen %= rem
    return gen


ans = 0

for i in range(5_000_000):
    A = get_next(A, factors[0], 4)
    B = get_next(B, factors[1], 8)
    
    if A & 0xFFFF == B & 0xFFFF:
        ans += 1

aocd_submit(ans)
```
