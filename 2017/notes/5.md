# Day 5 - A Maze of Twisty Trampolines, All Alike

> [<- Yesterday](4.md) | [Tomorrow ->](6.md)

Cool puzzle, I thought I did them pretty fast but it looks like this is the year where things got very fast. Glad I was able to get points at least!

|        | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Time   | 3:31   | 0:44   | 4:15  |
| Points | 0      | 38     | 38    |

## Part 1

Super simple, had a bit of an issue because I accidentally saved the program index instead of the offset, so I got stuck at program index 0.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
program = [int(x) for x in din]

idx = 0
steps = 0

while idx < len(program):
    temp = program[idx]
    program[idx] += 1
    idx += temp
    steps += 1

aocd_submit(steps)
```

## Part 2

Straightforward change, decrement if the offset is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise increment. Took longer to run but got there in the end.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
program = [int(x) for x in din]

idx = 0
steps = 0

while idx < len(program):
    temp = program[idx]
    if temp >= 3:
        program[idx] -= 1
    else:
        program[idx] += 1
    idx += temp
    steps += 1

aocd_submit(steps)
```
