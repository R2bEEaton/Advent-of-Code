# Day 17 - Spinlock

> [<- Yesterday](16.md) | [Tomorrow ->](18.md)

Hard Part 2, so I just bruteforced it lol.

|        | Part 1 | Part 2  | Total   |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Time   | 5:26   | 1:18:12 | 1:23:38 |
| Points | 43     | 0       | 43      |

## Part 1

Just a matter of implementing the algorithm, which I did with a `deque` and modular arithmetic for moving around in a circular fashion.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from collections import deque

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)
din = int(din)

spinlock = deque([0])

pos = 0
for i in range(1, 2017+1):
    pos += din
    pos %= i
    spinlock.insert(pos + 1, i)
    pos += 1

aocd_submit(spinlock[spinlock.index(2017) + 1])
```

## Part 2

I could not figure this one out, so I just did the ugly bruteforce. It must have taken 40 minutes. I sped it up with a singly linked list so that advancing `m` spaces in the circular list only took `O(m)` instead of `O(n)` where n is the number of items in the list. Combined with the `O(1)` insertions, it was much faster than using a `list` or even a `deque` but still took a long time.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from llist import sllist

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)
din = int(din)

spinlock = sllist()
spinlock.append(0)

curr = spinlock.first
for i in range(1, 50000000+1):
    for _ in range(din+1):
        if curr.next is None:
            curr = spinlock.first
        else:
            curr = curr.next
    spinlock.insertafter(i, curr)
    if i % 10000 == 0:
        print(i)

aocd_submit(spinlock[1])
```
