Had to go grab some code from [Day 10](10.md).

## Part 1

I did this part really slow because I was very unclear on what the Knot Hash was. In the Day 10 problem, the hash is described in Part 1 as a single round of the Knot Hash. In Part 2, is there always an addition to the end of a sequence? I just wasn't clear on which part of the code to copy. Turns out, it was all of it. And then just convert to binary at the end and count the `1`'s.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import re
from collections import deque

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)


def knot_hash(inp):
    inp = [ord(x) for x in inp] + [17, 31, 73, 47, 23]

    size = 256
    L = deque(x for x in range(size))

    def reverse(arr, l, r):
        for i in range((r-l+1) // 2):
            temp = arr[(l+i)%size]
            arr[(l+i)%size] = arr[(r-i)%size]
            arr[(r-i)%size] = temp

    pos = 0
    skip_size = 0
    for _ in range(64):
        for num in inp:
            reverse(L, pos, pos + num - 1)
            pos += num + skip_size
            skip_size += 1

    L = list(L)
    out = ""
    for i in range(0, 256, 16):
        res = 0
        for x in L[i:i+16]:
            res ^= x
        out += hex(res)[2:].zfill(2)

    out2 = []
    for c in out:
        out2.append(str(bin(int(c, 16)))[2:].zfill(4))
    return("".join(out2))


ans = 0
for i in range(128):
    hash = knot_hash(f"{din}-{i}")
    ans += hash.count('1')

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2
brief notes
```python

    def reverse(arr, l, r):
        for i in range((r-l+1) // 2):
            temp = arr[(l+i)%size]
            arr[(l+i)%size] = arr[(r-i)%size]
            arr[(r-i)%size] = temp

    pos = 0
    skip_size = 0
    for _ in range(64):
        for num in inp:

M = Matrix((128, 128))

ans = 0
for i in range(128):
    hash = knot_hash(f"{din}-{i}")
    for x, c in enumerate(hash):
        M.set((i, x), c)
    ans += hash.count('1')

seen = set()
groups = 0

for pos in M.findall('1'):
    if pos in seen:
        continue
    groups += 1
    
    next = [pos]
    while next:
        curr = next.pop()
        if curr in seen:
            continue
        seen.add(curr)
        for nei, val in M.neighbors(curr):
            if val == '1':
                next.append(nei)

aocd_submit(groups)
```
