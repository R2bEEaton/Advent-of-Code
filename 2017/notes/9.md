# Day 9 - Stream Processing

> [<- Yesterday](8.md) | [Tomorrow ->](10.md)

A fun puzzle! It was cool to implement, but otherwise easy to just follow the rules and test.

Unfortunately the extension I was using to record start times was inactive, so I estimated my start time at 22:22 due to creating the file at 22:20 and opening my input in the browser at 22:24. I'll count it anyway since this is just for fun anyway.

|        | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Time   | 7:33   | 3:45   | 11:18 |
| Points | 53     | 7      | 60    |

## Part 1

Just implementing the rules of the scanning! I have two flags for `!` (ignoring) and garbage `<>` and act accordingly.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

ans = 0
nest = 0
ignore = False
garbage = False

for i in range(len(din)):
    if ignore:
        ignore = False
        continue

    if din[i] == "{" and not garbage:
        nest += 1
        ans += nest
    if din[i] == "}" and not garbage:
        nest -= 1

    if din[i] == "<":
        garbage = True
    if din[i] == ">":
        garbage = False
    
    if din[i] == "!":
        ignore = True


aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

Quick modification to count non-`!` and non-ignored characters inside garbage brackets.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

ignore = False
garbage = False
garbage_chars = 0

for i in range(len(din)):
    if ignore:
        ignore = False
        continue

    if din[i] == "<" and not garbage:
        garbage = True
        garbage_chars -= 1
    if din[i] == ">":
        garbage = False
    
    if din[i] == "!":
        ignore = True
    elif garbage:
        garbage_chars += 1


aocd_submit(garbage_chars)
```
