# Day 13 - Packet Scanners

> [<- Yesterday](12.md) | [Tomorrow ->](14.md)

A fun problem, glad I decided to do the math instead of simulate it!

|        | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Time   | 7:04   | 2:30   | 9:34  |
| Points | 74     | 89     | 163   |

## Part 1

Came up with some math to generate the position of the scanner at each layer at the time when my packet enters. Then for each, if the scanner is there, add the severity.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

scanners = {x: y for x, y in din}
scanners_conf = {x: x % (y * 2 - 2) for x, y in din}

ans = 0

for k, v in scanners_conf.items():
    if v == 0:
        ans += k * scanners[k]

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

I just tested each increasing delay amount until it worked. I know there's probably a better way to do it with remainders and stuff, but this is fine for me.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

scanners = {x: y for x, y in din}

i = 0
while True:
    scanners_conf = {x: (i + x) % (y * 2 - 2) for x, y in din}
    if 0 not in scanners_conf.values():
        aocd_submit(i)
        break
    i += 1
```
