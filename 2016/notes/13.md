# Day 13

A fun problem! I liked how the maze was infinite but deterministic.

## Part 1

After Day 11, I discovered the Python module AStar and wanted to use it for fun. Turns out the problem didn't really need any heuristics, but I figured I'd be ready for it in Part 2.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from astar import AStar
import math

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

def good(x, y):
    return str(bin(x*x + 3*x + 2*x*y + y + y*y + int(din))[2:]).count('1') % 2 == 0

class MazePath(AStar):
    def distance_between(self, n1, n2):
        return math.dist(n1, n2)
    
    def heuristic_cost_estimate(self, current, goal):
        return self.distance_between(current, goal)
    
    def neighbors(self, node):
        x, y = node
        return [(nx, ny) for nx, ny in[(x, y - 1), (x, y + 1), (x - 1, y), (x + 1, y)]if 0 <= nx and 0 <= ny and good(nx, ny)]

m = MazePath().astar((1, 1), (31, 39))
aocd_submit(len(list(m)) - 1)
```

## Part 2

As you can see, I totally ripped out the AStar code, and just ran a breadth first search keeping track of seen positions. I had an error in my first submission since I ran 49 steps instead of 50. Pretty quick though!

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

def good(x, y):
    return str(bin(x*x + 3*x + 2*x*y + y + y*y + int(din))[2:]).count('1') % 2 == 0

seen = set()

steps = 0
visit_next = set()
init = (1, 1)
visit_next.add(init)
while steps <= 50:
    new_visit_next = set()
    for pos in visit_next:
        if pos in seen:
            continue
        seen.add(pos)
        x, y = pos
        new_visit_next.update([(nx, ny) for nx, ny in[(x, y - 1), (x, y + 1), (x - 1, y), (x + 1, y)]if 0 <= nx and 0 <= ny and good(nx, ny)])
    visit_next = new_visit_next
    steps += 1


aocd_submit(len(seen))
```
