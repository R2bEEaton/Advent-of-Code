# Day 3

Wow! A super quick one. Juding by the 2016 leaderboard, that would be 28th and 9th. But of course, many fewer people were playing back then.

## Part 1

Super clean code to generate all combinations of side lengths to compare, and then if any are impossible the triangle is bad! This actually doubles the necessary work since `(0, 1, 2)` is considered distinct from `(1, 0, 2)` when checking `a + b > c`. But it's just 6 total, so I didn't worry about it.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import itertools

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

ans = 0

for line in din:
    good = True
    for comb in itertools.permutations([0, 1, 2], 3):
        if line[comb[0]] + line[comb[1]] <= line[comb[2]]:
            good = False
            break
    if good:
        ans += 1

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

SUPER quick turnaround, I used the `batched` function and read the input in groups of 3 lines and then checked the 3 columns. This was made super easy by how I did the combinations checking in Part 1.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import itertools

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

ans = 0

for lines in itertools.batched(din, n=3):
    for x in range(3):
        good = True
        for comb in itertools.permutations([0, 1, 2], 3):
            if lines[comb[0]][x] + lines[comb[1]][x] <= lines[comb[2]][x]:
                good = False
                break
        if good:
            ans += 1

aocd_submit(ans)
```
