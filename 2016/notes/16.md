## Part 1

Rather simply, just did it. It took me a while to understand the instructions, but implementing them took longer due to sloppy code.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import itertools

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)
disk = 272

while len(din) < disk:
    a = din
    b = a[::-1]
    b = "".join(['0' if x == '1' else '1' for x in b])
    din = a + '0' + b

chk = din[:disk]
while len(chk) % 2 == 0:
    new_chk = ""
    for batch in itertools.batched(chk, 2):
        if "".join(batch) in ['00', '11']:
            new_chk += '1'
        else:
            new_chk += '0'
    chk = new_chk

aocd_submit(chk)
```

## Part 2

This is where it fell apart. I started running my code with the increased size and saw that it was taking way too long. I should have just added a few print statements... but basically it was slow. I noticed immediately that `35651584 = 272 * (2 ^ 17)` and 17 was the length of the checksum, so I thought that maybe it was something silly like inverting the bits, or just the same answer again, or reversed. I tried several combinations of those, then I tried to find patterns in the checksum by looking at `272 * (2 ^ 1)`, `272 * (2 ^ 2)`, and so on. This didn't get me anywhere, so I gave up and looked at Reddit. All these people were getting solutions in under 10 seconds with code just like mine, what gives!

Turns out string concatenation is really slow since strings are obviously immutable. Using a list for the checksum solved it in a few seconds.

For a much, much more detailed O(1) mathematical solution [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/5ititq/2016_day_16_c_how_to_tame_your_dragon_in_under_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) goes above and beyond.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import itertools

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)
disk = 272 * (2 ** 17)

while len(din) < disk:
    a = din
    b = a[::-1]
    b = "".join(['0' if x == '1' else '1' for x in b])
    din = a + '0' + b

chk = din[:disk]
while len(chk) % 2 == 0:
    new_chk = []
    for batch in itertools.batched(chk, 2):
        if "".join(batch) in ['00', '11']:
            new_chk.append('1')
        else:
            new_chk.append('0')
    chk = "".join(new_chk)

aocd_submit(chk)
```
