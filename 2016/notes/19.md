# Day 19

This took a while. Apparently there's some link to the Josephus problem, but I didn't know it. So it took a while.

## Part 1

 Python doesn't have linked lists or a way to do O(1) deletions, unless I used a deque maybe!?! I'm not sure, but simulating it wasn't working due to O(n^2) at least, so I insetad looked at each round and tried to come up with a pattern. I was also in an airport with a flight delayed 3.5 hours. Anyway, I noticed first that after each round around the circle, the first or last person always makes it to the next round and that there were predictable patterns for who the other person would be. Then logically if you apply these rules over and over until the first and the last person are the same person, then that's the answer!

 So I discovered some rules about odd and even circle sizes and how those should change, mostly involving powers of 2 and floor division. Pretty proud of noticing and coming up with that.

 Turns out the answer is just `int(bin(N)[3:] + bin(N)[2], 2)` so that's fun. No idea why. I got that after looking at the Reddit solutions thread.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

# elves = [i + 1 for i in range(int(din))]

# i = 1
# while len(elves) > 1:
#     # print(i, elves[i % len(elves)], elves)
#     del elves[i % len(elves)]
#     if i >= len(elves):
#         print(elves)
#         i = 1
#     else:
#         i += 1


def process(x, y, l, i):
    if l == 1:
        return x
    if l % 2 != 0:
        return process(x + 2 ** i, y, l // 2, i + 1)
    return process(x, y - (2 ** (i - 1)), l // 2, i + 1)


aocd_submit(process(1, int(din), int(din), 1))

```

## Part 2

I wasn't getting this one. Again, also probably solveable with a linked list or pointer structure to the center of the circle. I even tried two `deque`s but I couldn't get the logic right, so I ended up looking at the Reddit thread to see if there was some faster solution. I saw someone mention *the pattern in the answers after looking for n = 1 .. 100* so I coded a naive solution and then looked at the pattern. Looks like every power of 3, the answer is itself, and then after that it starts counting up from 1, until the counter becomes that previous power of 3, at which point you add two. Again, no idea why, which is kind of frustrating.

I ended up solving it in the air and then submitted my answer as soon as I landed... at 2:30AM local time... after 9 hours of travel.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from collections import deque
import math

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)
din = int(din)


def check_naive(din):
    elves = list(range(1, din + 1))

    while len(elves) != 1:
        del elves[len(elves) // 2]
        saved = elves[0]
        del elves[0]
        elves.append(saved)

    return elves[0]


def check_pattern(din):
    exponent = math.log(din, 3)
    closest = 3 ** int(exponent)
    curr = closest
    ans = 0
    while curr != din:
        if ans < closest:
            ans += 1
        else:
            ans += 2
        curr += 1
    return din if ans == 0 else ans


# for i in range(1, 1000):
#     if check_naive(i) != check_better(i):
#         print("WRong", i, check_naive(i), check_pattern(i))

aocd_submit(check_pattern(din))
```
