# Day 9

Took pretty long for Part 2...

|      | Part 1 | Part 2  | Total   |
|------|--------|---------|---------|
| Time | 12:34  | 1:07:06 | 1:19:40 |

## Part 1

I implemented some simple logic for expanding out the string, not too complicated, hence the quick-ish time. I was trying to be smart and use regular expressions, which cost me a lot of time in Part 2.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import re

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

out = ""
duplicate = [1, 1]
marker = False

i = 0
while i < len(din):
    if din[i] == "(" and not marker:
        grouping = re.search(r'\(\d+x\d+\)', din[i:]).group()
        duplicate = [int(x) for x in re.findall(r'\d+', grouping)]
        i += len(grouping)
        marker = True
    else:
        out += "".join(din[i:i+duplicate[0]] * duplicate[1])
        i += duplicate[0]
        duplicate = [1, 1]
        marker = False

aocd_submit(len(out))

```

## Part 2

I needed to reference [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/5hbygy/comment/daz279z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) for Part 2 becuase I was struggling through regular expression logic and not thinking about my base cases and recurive cases too well. I was almost there, but this comment helped me through it. I still managed to use my regular expresisons.

The main issue in my previous version was only expanding the *next* marker, not all markers inside the current expansion.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import re

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

def expand(s):
    if "(" not in s:
        return len(s)

    tot = 0
    while True:
        try:
            marker = re.match(r'([^\(]*)(\(\d+x\d+\))', s).groups()
            s = s[sum(len(x) for x in marker):]
            dup = [int(x) for x in re.findall(r'\d+', marker[1])]
            tot += len(marker[0]) + expand(s[:dup[0]]) * dup[1]
            s = s[dup[0]:]
        except:
            break

    tot += len(s)
    return tot

aocd_submit(expand(din))
```
