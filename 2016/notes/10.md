# Day 10

A brute force problem with surprisingly little description. Are you supposed to read the instructions sequentially? I guess it all worked out, but I must have read it over a dozen times to make sure I didn't miss something.

## Part 1

My biggest issue here was parsing. I had done it in a way that I was pretty proud of at the start, but for a decent amount of time I had `"o"` instead of `"u"` for the *o* in b**o**t rather than the *u* in outp**u**t. I was assigning bot chips to the output and vice versa. After figuring that out, it was pretty straightforward and then realizing that we actually don't want the output, we want to see which bot compares. And then also realizing that not every bot does its duty on the first iteration, so just looping through until we see a bot compare the two numbers in question. Who comes up with these!? (Thanks Eric Wastl!)

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from collections import defaultdict
import re

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

bots = defaultdict(list)
output = defaultdict(list)

for line in din:
    if line.startswith("value"):
        nums = re.findall(r'\d+', line)
        bots[nums[1]].append(int(nums[0]))

while True:
    for line in din:
        if line.startswith("value"):
            continue
        nums = re.findall(r'.t \d+', line)
        instr = [x.split(" ") for x in nums]
        if len(bots[instr[0][1]]) != 2:
            continue
        if sorted(bots[instr[0][1]]) == [17, 61]:
            aocd_submit(instr[0][1])
            exit()
        if instr[1][0][0] == "u":
            output[instr[1][1]].append(min(bots[instr[0][1]]))
        else:
            bots[instr[1][1]].append(min(bots[instr[0][1]]))
        if instr[2][0][0] == "u":
            output[instr[2][1]].append(max(bots[instr[0][1]]))
        else:
            bots[instr[2][1]].append(max(bots[instr[0][1]]))
        bots[instr[0][1]].clear()

```

## Part 2

Quick change to check when the bots are done doing their thing and then multiply the values from the requested output bins.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from collections import defaultdict
import re

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

bots = defaultdict(list)
output = defaultdict(list)

for line in din:
    if line.startswith("value"):
        nums = re.findall(r'\d+', line)
        bots[nums[1]].append(int(nums[0]))

did_something = True
while did_something:
    did_something = False
    for line in din:
        if line.startswith("value"):
            continue
        nums = re.findall(r'.t \d+', line)
        instr = [x.split(" ") for x in nums]
        if len(bots[instr[0][1]]) != 2:
            continue
        did_something = True
        if instr[1][0][0] == "u":
            output[instr[1][1]].append(min(bots[instr[0][1]]))
        else:
            bots[instr[1][1]].append(min(bots[instr[0][1]]))
        if instr[2][0][0] == "u":
            output[instr[2][1]].append(max(bots[instr[0][1]]))
        else:
            bots[instr[2][1]].append(max(bots[instr[0][1]]))
        bots[instr[0][1]].clear()

aocd_submit(output['0'][0] * output['1'][0] * output['2'][0])

```
