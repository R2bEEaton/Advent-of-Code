# Day 14

Just a bruteforce puzzle. I feel bad for anyone who was using a language without a good standard library including hash functions. In 2016, this would have been 9th and 8th places respectively!

## Part 1

I re-calcuate hashes a lot in this, but that's ok for a bit of code that runs in <10 seconds. Going for coding speed here, not speed of code.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from hashlib import md5
import re

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

keys = []

def check_next_1000(i, c):
    for j in range(i + 1, i + 1000):
        if c * 5 in md5(bytes(din + str(j), encoding='UTF-8')).hexdigest():
            return True
    return False

index = 0
while len(keys) != 64:
    key = din + str(index)
    matches = re.findall(r'(.)\1\1', md5(bytes(key, encoding='UTF-8')).hexdigest())
    if matches:
        if check_next_1000(index, matches[0][0]):
            keys.append(index)
    index += 1

aocd_submit(keys[-1])

```

## Part 2

I tried to save a little bit of work by caching the additional 2016 hashes because I knew that would take a while and, without knowing how long it would have taken without it, I'll just assume that did the trick.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from hashlib import md5
import functools
import re

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

keys = []

def check_next_1000(i, c):
    for j in range(i + 1, i + 1000):
        if c * 5 in hash(j):
            return True
    return False

@functools.cache
def hash(i):
    init = md5(bytes(din + str(i), encoding='UTF-8')).hexdigest()
    for _ in range(2016):
        init = md5(bytes(init, encoding='UTF-8')).hexdigest()
    return init


index = 0
while len(keys) != 64:
    matches = re.findall(r'(.)\1\1', hash(index))
    if matches:
        if check_next_1000(index, matches[0][0]):
            keys.append(index)
    index += 1

aocd_submit(keys[-1])

```
