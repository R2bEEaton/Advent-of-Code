## Part 1

I was super close for Part 1, I developed the entire regex but kept getting issues and went to bed. But then when I woke up in the morning. I had inspiration since I had thought about it during the night and realized that I was connecting the bracketed sections together. So I just added a single space so that different sections wouldn't appear next to eachother and cause false positives.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import re

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

ans = 0
for line in din:
    matches_inside = re.findall(r'(.)(.)(?=\2\1)', re.sub(r'\][^]]*\[|^[^\]]*\[|\][^\[]*$', ' ', line))
    matches_inside = list(filter(lambda x: x[0] != x[1], matches_inside))

    matches = re.findall(r'(.)(.)(?=\2\1)', re.sub(r'\[[^\[]*\]', ' ', line))
    matches = list(filter(lambda x: x[0] != x[1], matches))
    
    ans += 1 if len(matches) and not len(matches_inside) else 0

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

This one took a bit, I got the Regex sorted, but I was not detecting overlaps. I was able to detect overlaps on the last character of a group, but not the last two characters. My test case was `zazazaza` which should have 6 matches. I ended up referencing Reddit for the idea to use a positive lookahead for the entire match, and that I need a `.` after the negative lookahead because apparently I forgot you need to match *something* after not matching another thing.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import re

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

ans = 0
for line in din:
    matches_inside = re.findall(r'(?=((.)(?!\2).\2))', re.sub(r'\][^]]*\[|^[^\]]*\[|\][^\[]*$', '  ', line))
    matches_inside = [x[0] for x in matches_inside]

    matches = re.findall(r'(?=((.)(?!\2).\2))', re.sub(r'\[[^\[]*\]', '  ', line))
    matches = [x[0] for x in matches]

    for inside in matches_inside:
        if f"{inside[1]}{inside[0]}{inside[1]}" in matches:
            ans += 1
            break

aocd_submit(ans)
```
