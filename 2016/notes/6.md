# Day 6

VERY fast. If we're going based on 2016 times, that would put me at 61st and 44th.

|      | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Time | 3:57   | 0:30   | 4:27  |

## Part 1

Super elegant code in my opinion. Make a counter for each column then sort the items for each column by the value.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from collections import defaultdict

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

letters = [defaultdict(int) for _ in range(len(din[0]))]

for line in din:
    for i, c in enumerate(line):
        letters[i][c] += 1

ans = ""
for col in letters:
    items = list(col.items())
    items.sort(key= lambda x: x[1])
    ans += items[-1][0]

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

Literally just changed one character for this Part 2, super satisfying.

```diff
- ans += items[-1][0] # Most common
+ ans += items[0][0] # Least common
```
