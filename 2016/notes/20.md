## Part 1

Every possible smallest value will be one greater than the maximum range of each input, if and only if that value is also not contained in another blacklist. As such, you can narrow down candidate values and then get the smallest one.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
din = [[int(x) for x in y.split('-')] for y in din]

possible = []


def good(i):
    for vals in din:
        x, y = vals
        if x <= i <= y:
            return False
    return True


for vals in din:
    if good(vals[1] + 1):
        possible.append(vals[1] + 1)

aocd_submit(min(possible))
```

## Part 2

I initially used `len(possible)`, but it said it was too high so I did some further checking. Turns out I was missing a check in `good()` for whether the number is less than the range itself, since there was evidently a range that ended at `n^32`. Before realizing that, I realized I coded a check to start at each possible value to see if there were more options. In hindsight, I should have just tried subtracting 1 since it told me it was too high, but alas.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
din = [[int(x) for x in y.split('-')] for y in din]

possible = []


def good(i):
    for vals in din:
        x, y = vals
        if x <= i <= y:
            return False
    return True if i < 2**32 else False # Needed to add this check, which originally called len(possible) to be +1


for vals in din:
    if good(vals[1] + 1):
        possible.append(vals[1] + 1)

total = 0
for val in possible:
    i = val
    while good(i):
        i += 1
        total += 1

aocd_submit(total) # Seems to be same as len(possible) !?
```
