## Part 1

I was proud of my idea to use a custom sorting function. I was originally going to use a compare function but then I realized I could put the count of each letter into the hundreds place and the numerical order of the letter into the ones place. This would automatically handle precedence, preferring higher counts, ties broken by alphabetical. Reminds me of bucket sort a little bit.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from collections import defaultdict

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

ans = 0
for line in din:
    letters = defaultdict(int)
    for c in line:
        if c.isalpha():
            letters[c] += 1
        elif c == '[':
            break

    chk = line[-6:-1]
    id = int(line[-10:-7])

    checksum = list(letters.items())
    checksum.sort(key = lambda x : x[1] * 100 + 65 - ord(x[0]), reverse=True)
    checksum = "".join([x[0] for x in checksum][:5])
    
    if checksum == chk:
        ans += id

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

This one took a decent amount of time to come up with the looping logic but after thinking through it, it worked on the first try! Then I just had to clean it up and CTRL+F to the solution! I then coded in the check for "north" or "object". I also noticed after checking the output in more detail that the word "object" uniquely finds the solution, but I feel that would be impossible to have coded for ahead of time without looking.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from collections import defaultdict

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

ans = 0
for line in din:
    id = int(line[-10:-7])

    unenc = ""
    for i in range(len(line[:-10])):
        if not line[i].isalpha():
            continue
        unenc += chr(((ord(line[i]) - 97 + id % 26) % 26) + 97)
    if "north" in unenc and "object" in unenc:
        aocd_submit(id)
        exit()
```
