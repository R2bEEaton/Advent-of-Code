# Day 15

An easily bruteforceable problem on modern hardware. In 2016 this would be 14th and 8th.

## Part 1

I knew it was most likely going to have to do with solving a system of equations but for such a small number of discs I decided to bruteforce it. I didn't consider that it takes 1 second to drop to the first disc, so that's why my time starts at -1.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

discs = []

for line in din:
    discs.append([line[1], line[3]])


def isgood(discs):
    for i, disc in enumerate(discs):
        if (disc[1] + i) % disc[0] != 0:
            return False
    return True
    

time = -1
while not isgood(discs):
    for disc in discs:
        disc[1] = (disc[1] + 1) % disc[0]
    time += 1

aocd_submit(time)
```

## Part 2

Very simply, I just appended the extra disc to my checker and it gave an answer in a couple of seconds.

```python
discs.append([11, 0])
```

## Part 3

I knew that wasn't the right way to do it, so I wanted to practice doing it the right way for the upcoming 2024 calendar. I decided to use Sympy for this, and I initially started out by building the following system of equations:

```
# For the example, this would be the system of equations.
(4 + t + 1) % 5 == 0
(1 + t + 2) % 2 == 0
```

But, as I soon discovered, Sympy can't solve systems of equations involving modulus for obvious reasons - solutions for `(x + y) % z = 0`, when solved for `x` may be in the form `x = -y + z * n` for any integer `n`. The Chinese Remainder Theorem strikes again. Turns out using Sympy wasn't too far off and it has a convenient solver for a series of moduli and remainders. Coming up with the desired remainders took a while for me, but, in words, it's the position you want the disk to be at `t + 1` time steps before you drop it the ball.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from sympy.ntheory.modular import crt

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

mr = [[], []]

for i, line in enumerate(din + [[None, 11, None, 0]]):
    mr[0].append(line[1])
    mr[1].append(line[1] - (line[3] + i + 1) % line[1])

aocd_submit(crt(*mr, check=True)[0])
```
