# Day 11

Wow that was pretty good wasn't it. That would have been 81st and 61st in 2016!

## Part 1

I saw ahead of time from some stats that today was supposed to be pretty hard. I went through it with my wife, who does not code but likes puzzles, and we worked out a general solution. We got from the beginning that we'd need to do a BFS, searching through each state and the next subsequent states until a solution. It took a little bit to logic the way through and code it.

Then I started running it and it worked for the example input pretty quickly, but was taking impossibly long for the real input. So I spent a long time refactoring it away from lists to tuples so that it could be memoized. Hence the `tuple_to_list` and inversely named `list_to_tuple` functions, helping me convert from using lists. It worked in the end and generated the right answer in not too long.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import functools
import itertools
import copy
import re

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

floors = []

for line in din:
    chips = re.findall(r'([a-z]+)-[a-z]+ .', line)
    generators = re.findall(r'([a-z]+) generator', line)
    floors.append(tuple(sorted([x + "M" for x in chips] + [x + "G" for x in generators])))

floors = tuple(floors)


@functools.cache
def valid(state):
    good = True
    for floor in state:
        unmatched = [x for x in floor if x[-1] == "M" and x[:-1] + "G" not in floor]
        if unmatched and any([True for x in floor if x[-1] == "G"]):
            good = False
            break
    return good


def tuple_to_list(tpl):
    out = []
    for item in tpl:
        if isinstance(item, tuple):
            out.append(tuple_to_list(sorted(item)))
        else:
            out.append(item)
    return out


def list_to_tuple(tpl):
    out = []
    for item in tpl:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            out.append(list_to_tuple(sorted(item)))
        else:
            out.append(item)
    return tuple(out)


@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def get_next_states(floor_num, state):
    combinations = list(itertools.combinations(list(state[floor_num]), 2)) + [[x] for x in list(state[floor_num])]
    next_states = []

    for group in combinations:
        if not group:
            continue
        updown = []
        if floor_num + 1 <= 3:
            updown.append(1)
        if floor_num - 1 >= 0:
            updown.append(-1)
        for i in updown:
            state_copy = tuple_to_list(copy.deepcopy(state))
            for item in group:
                state_copy[floor_num].remove(item)
                state_copy[floor_num+i].append(item)
            state_copy = list_to_tuple(state_copy)
            if valid(state_copy):
                next_states.append((floor_num+i, state_copy))
                
    return next_states


states_to_search = set()
states_to_search.add((0, floors))

steps = 0
while states_to_search:
    print(steps, len(states_to_search))
    new_states_to_search = set()
    for state in states_to_search:
        if not state[1][0] and not state[1][1] and not state[1][2]:
            aocd_submit(steps)
            exit()
        new_states_to_search.update(get_next_states(*state))
    states_to_search = new_states_to_search
    steps += 1
```

## Part 2

For this part, I added some code to add the extra microchips and generators, but saw that it was going just as slow as Part 1 without the memoization. So, what did I do? I removed one of the pairs and saw that it was running quicker. I let it finish and saw that with this pair it took 12 extra steps than my original input. Since there was an additional pair to add, I figured it would take an additional 12 steps, so I added that to the answer and it ended up working!

But that's not satisfying. I knew it probably had to do with a heuristic, but I didn't feel like updating my code to use A*. I now realize I was probably overcomplicating it in my head, since I could just use a priority queue and otherwise keep most of the code the same.

I took to Reddit and found [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/5hoia9/comment/db1v1ws/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) which pointed out that the most important optimization was realizing that every pair of generators and microchips is equivalent from a standpoint of states, which makes sense, but I don't know if I would have thought of that.

In lieu of posting the entire code, I'll just highlight this new function `convert_state_to_general()` and how it gets used in `valid()`. I made a dumb function to generalize the state and then just keep track of ones it has seen before. It was still pretty slow since I wasn't using any heuristics, but it ran in a couple of minutes and reiterated the correct answer.

```python
def convert_state_to_general(state):
    general = []
    i = 0
    seen = []
    for floor in state:
        flr = []
        for item in floor:
            if item[:-1] not in seen:
                i = len(seen)
                seen.append(item[:-1])
            else:
                i = seen.index(item[:-1])
            flr.append(str(i) + item[-1])
        general.append(tuple(flr))
    return tuple(general)


@functools.cache
def valid(state):
    if convert_state_to_general(state) not in equivalent_states:
        equivalent_states.add(convert_state_to_general(state))
    else:
        return False
    good = True
    for floor in state:
        unmatched = [x for x in floor if x[-1] == "M" and x[:-1] + "G" not in floor]
        if unmatched and any([True for x in floor if x[-1] == "G"]):
            good = False
            break
    return good
```
