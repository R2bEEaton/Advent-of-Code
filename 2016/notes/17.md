# Day 17

Another cool procedurally generated maze! In 2016 this would have been 69th and 67th.

## Part 1

As you can see, I prepped for A* again but ended up removing it for the same reason as last time in [Day 13](13.md). Lots of hashing this year!

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from astar import AStar
import math
import hashlib

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

class MazePath(AStar):
    def distance_between(self, n1, n2):
        x1, y1, _ = n1
        x2, y2, _ = n2
        return math.dist((x1, y1), (x2, y2))
    
    def heuristic_cost_estimate(self, current, goal):
        return self.distance_between(current, goal)
    
    def neighbors(self, node):
        x, y, key = node

        hashed = hashlib.md5(bytes(key, encoding='UTF-8')).hexdigest()[:4]
        doors = [True if x in 'bcdef' else False for x in hashed]
        directions = [(x, y - 1, 'U'), (x, y + 1, 'D'), (x - 1, y, 'L'), (x + 1, y, 'R')]
        valid = []
        for i, door in enumerate(doors):
            if door:
                valid.append(directions[i])

        return [(nx, ny, key + udlr) for nx, ny, udlr in valid if 0 <= nx <= 3 and 0 <= ny <= 3]
    
    def is_goal_reached(self, current, goal):
        x, y, _ = current
        return (x, y) == (3, 3)

m = MazePath().astar((0, 0, din), (3, 3, 0))
aocd_submit(list(m)[-1][2][len(din):])
```

## Part 2

As mentioned, I needed to rip out the A* code, but was able to keep the neighbors and decided to keep the goal code. Then I just expand until all paths end, keeping track of longer and longer solutions over time. Fortunately the paths ended fairly quickly. At first, I did not have the `continue` in the loop because I wasn't sure if paths should end at the corner, but fortunately I saw that it was mentioned in the short Part 2 description after a re-read.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from astar import AStar
import math
import hashlib

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)
    

def neighbors(node):
    x, y, key = node

    hashed = hashlib.md5(bytes(key, encoding='UTF-8')).hexdigest()[:4]
    doors = [True if x in 'bcdef' else False for x in hashed]
    directions = [(x, y - 1, 'U'), (x, y + 1, 'D'), (x - 1, y, 'L'), (x + 1, y, 'R')]
    valid = []
    for i, door in enumerate(doors):
        if door:
            valid.append(directions[i])

    return [(nx, ny, key + udlr) for nx, ny, udlr in valid if 0 <= nx <= 3 and 0 <= ny <= 3]


def is_goal_reached(current, goal):
    x, y, _ = current
    return (x, y) == (3, 3)


explore = [(0, 0, din)]
max_len = 0
i = 0
while explore:
    new_explore = []
    for item in explore:
        if is_goal_reached(item, (3, 3, 0)):
            max_len = max(max_len, len(item[2]) - len(din))
            continue
        new_explore.extend(neighbors(item))
    explore = new_explore
    i += 1

aocd_submit(max_len)
```
