# Day 23

VERY cool. I feel like I did fast. According to the 2016 leaderboard, this would have been 29th and 47th, which in my book is pretty decent for a Day 23!

## Part 1

Modifying the code to work with `tgl` was a challenge, in addition to needing to find the bug in my [Day 12](12.md) code. `jnz` obviously should also be able to take a register or integer for either parameter, but the case where parameter 2 is an integer never came up in Day 12.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)

regs = {'a': 7, 'b': 0, 'c': 0, 'd': 0}

program = []

for line in din:
    line = line.split(" ")

    instr = line[0]
    x = line[1]
    y = None if len(line) < 3 else line[2]

    program.append([instr, x, y])

i = 0
while i < len(program):
    instr, x, y = program[i]

    try:
        if instr == "cpy":
            if x in regs:
                regs[y] = regs[x]
            else:
                regs[y] = int(x)
        elif instr == "inc":
            regs[x] += 1
        elif instr == "dec":
            regs[x] -= 1
        elif instr == "jnz":
            val = 0
            if x in regs:
                val = regs[x]
            else:
                val = int(x)

            if y in regs:
                valy = regs[y]
            else:
                valy = int(y)

            if val != 0:
                i += valy
                continue
        elif instr == "tgl":
            if x in regs:
                val = regs[x]
            else:
                val = int(x)
            if i + val < len(program):
                toggle = program[i + val]
                if toggle[2] is None:
                    toggle[0] = "dec" if toggle[0] == "inc" else "inc"
                else:
                    toggle[0] = "cpy" if toggle[0] == "jnz" else "jnz"
    except:
        None

    i += 1

aocd_submit(regs['a'])
```

## Part 2

This one was very clearly going to be about noticing patterns in the assembunny, and I am happy to report that I figured it out all by myself. I used the below code to test numbers between 6 and 10 (the only numbers I could run in a reasonable amount of time). I suspect 0-5 would actually never work, for certain reasons about my input. I tried plugging it into a regression calculator, but didn't get anything conclusive. I noticed there was only one `tgl` instruction in my input and it simply controlled whether the program would terminate or jump back somewhere, so it would be way easier to just figure out what the program is doing. So clearly multiple loops are being used to increment the `a` register.

I used a `defaultdict` to keep track of each increment and decrement of all the registers, and noticed that there were always (for my input) `5986` increments of `a` right before the end of the program's execution (since I traced the general structure of the program in my mind). Then I noticed that for `eggs = 6` the difference was 720, and for `eggs=7`, it was 5040 which is 7 times 720, and then the next one was 8 times 5040, and so on. So I simply extrapoldated that out! Add the constant factor to, in my case, `720 * 7..12`.

`5986 + 720 \* (7\*8\*9\*10\*11\*12)`, or more concisely, `5986 + 720 \* (12! / 6!)`.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from collections import defaultdict

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)


def solve_for(n):
    regs = {'a': n, 'b': 0, 'c': 0, 'd': 0}
    program = []
    most_common = defaultdict(int)

    for line in din:
        line = line.split(" ")

        instr = line[0]
        x = line[1]
        y = None if len(line) < 3 else line[2]

        program.append([instr, x, y])

    i = 0
    while i < len(program):
        instr, x, y = program[i]

        #print(instr, x, y)

        try:
            if instr == "cpy":
                if x in regs:
                    regs[y] = regs[x]
                else:
                    regs[y] = int(x)
            elif instr == "inc":
                regs[x] += 1
                most_common[f"({i}, {program[i]})"] += 1
            elif instr == "dec":
                regs[x] -= 1
                most_common[f"({i}, {program[i]})"] -= 1
            elif instr == "jnz":
                val = 0
                if x in regs:
                    val = regs[x]
                else:
                    val = int(x)

                if y in regs:
                    valy = regs[y]
                else:
                    valy = int(y)

                if val != 0:
                    i += valy
                    continue

                    if toggle[2] is None:
                        toggle[0] = "dec" if toggle[0] == "inc" else "inc"
                    else:
                        toggle[0] = "cpy" if toggle[0] == "jnz" else "jnz"
        except:
            None
            #print("invalid instruction reached")

    print(most_common)
    return regs['a']

for i in range(6, 11):
