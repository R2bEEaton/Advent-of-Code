# Day 22

Interesting puzzle. Got scared in Part 2 and looked at hints...

## Part 1

Simple! I was undercounting by half since I used `combinations` instead of `permutations`. In the moment, I solved by reversing the check for each combination.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import itertools

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)
din = din[2:]

ans = 0

for a, b in itertools.combinations(din, 2):
    ans += a[3] != 0 and a[3] <= b[4]
    ans += b[3] != 0 and b[3] <= a[4]

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2

I got really scared about this twist. I was leaning toward coding an A* algorithm with a basic heuristic (BFS) just to see if that would work, but I was thinking through the neighbors logic. In my head, I figured that any move from adjacent viable pairs from the previous Part would be a possible next move, and I'd need to keep track of the state of the entire "maze" since what if 8T from one node can fit in a partially filled adjacent node, now the one is empty and the other is more full, etc., etc.

So I caved and looked at the [r/AdventOfCode](https://reddit.com/r/AdventOfCode) subreddit for hints. Someone said they solved it by hand, so I decided to look more in detail at the example input and my input. OH! Every viable pair includes the empty node. Hence all nodes that could fit in the empty node are interchangeable (you know, like the Part 2 description said...) and their data will never be added to a partially filled node. And there are additionally some nodes that can't ever fit in the empty node or any other node, so those data can never be moved.

At this point it became a simple sliding tile puzzle, so I made some code to print out my board in the same format as the example, and I solved it by hand. Once I reached the goal data, I saw that it would take a sequence of 5 steps to shuffle it over to the left once, so I then multiplied the number of remaining tiles left to move by 5 and, after adding the number of states to shuffle the empty space to the goal node in the first place, that was the solution. Pretty cool!

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import itertools

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)
din = din[2:]

positions = {}

for a in din:
    for b in din:
        if a == b:
            continue
        if a[3] != 0 and a[3] <= b[4]:
            break
    else:
        if a[3] != 0:
            positions[(a[0], a[1])] = "#"
        else:
            positions[(a[0], a[1])] = "_"
        continue
    positions[(a[0], a[1])] = "."

for y in range(a[1] + 1):
    for x in range(a[0] + 1):
        print(positions[(x, y)], end="")
    print()

```
