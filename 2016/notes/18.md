# Day 18

It reminds me of an [Elementary Cellular Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton), which... it is. This would have been 51st and 33rd in 2016.

## Part 1

Simply implemented the generation rules and then added up the number of seen `.`'s. I now think a better way would have been accumulating them when setting the new line to a safe space, but that's ok. This runs instantly for Part 1.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

line = list('.' + din + '.')
safe = 0

for _ in range(40):
    new_line = line.copy()
    safe += new_line.count('.') - 2
    for i in range(1, len(line) - 1):
        if line[i - 1] == '^' and line[i] == '^' and line[i + 1] == '.':
            new_line[i] = '^'
            continue
        if line[i - 1] == '.' and line[i] == '^' and line[i + 1] == '^':
            new_line[i] = '^'
            continue
        if line[i - 1] == '^' and line[i] == '.' and line[i + 1] == '.':
            new_line[i] = '^'
            continue
        if line[i - 1] == '.' and line[i] == '.' and line[i + 1] == '^':
            new_line[i] = '^'
            continue
        new_line[i] = '.'
    line = new_line

aocd_submit(safe)
```

## Part 2

And it runs in 17s on my machine for Part 2. I suspect the big inefficiencies are the logically unnecessary copy of the previous line into the next line and the count function, but it was quick enough to code and ran in a decent amount of time. All I needed to do was increase the number of generations to 400,000.

After the fact, for fun I took a look at the generation rules and noticed that the next position was a `^` if and only if there was at most one `^` to the left and the right, so I decided to code that in as a bitwise XOR.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)

line = list('.' + din + '.')
safe = 0

for _ in range(400000):
    new_line = line.copy()
    safe += new_line.count('.') - 2
    for i in range(1, len(line) - 1):
        if int(line[i - 1] == '^') ^ int(line[i + 1] == '^'):
            new_line[i] = '^'
            continue
        new_line[i] = '.'
    line = new_line

aocd_submit(safe)
```
