# Ryan Eaton's Advent of Code 2016

A repository to store my solutions for [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016).

**Different from other annotated years so far, this year was done entirely asyncronously. I am starting on 2024-11-21 as practice for Advent of Code 2024. As such, times will be relative to when the puzzle was opened in my browser, as recorded by [this browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/advent-of-code-part-2-tim/fhmjpoppaplfhgnknpbaaklgdnnimfbn?pli=1).**

Solutions will be slightly refactored for readability before submission. In other words...

```diff
+ Refactor to remove unused code
- No logic changes allowed
- No fixing the stupid or unnecessary checks I wrote
+ Code must produce valid solutions
```

I'm going for speed. This repository is not an example of good code. It won't be pretty.

## Earnings and Emojis

This is pretty much a table of contents for my solutions and a corresponding emoji sentence for each day.
